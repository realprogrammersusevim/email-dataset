Re: Lite SMTP server/daemon
















Hi Celejar,




Thank you for your reply.




I use Linux running in Compact Flash so that the size of the Compact flash memory is the 
limit




Users will send emails to a program running in the Compact flash so I need a mail server 
there too.




Only SMTP, no POP3 server




Can you suggest something?











Thank you .




Best regards,




Lad.
