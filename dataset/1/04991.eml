[Webdev] mod_rewrite question I'm trying to wrap Zope up behind apache, so I can do VirtualHosts for
Zope.

 I've a site on http://ip:8080/mysite.

 I want that to appear as http://mysite.com/ - so:


        ServerName mysite.com
        DocumentRoot /var/www/mysite
        RewriteEngine                   on
        RewriteRule     ^/(.*)    http://localhost:8080/mysite/$1 [P]


 Now, what happens is that apache grabs http://localhost:8080/mysite/ and spits
it out to the browser. Lovely. all works.

 Except for framed pages (like Zope's management interface). It ends up
looking like:

    







 and of course, that's not what my client should go to. Any ideas what I'm
doing wrong ?
