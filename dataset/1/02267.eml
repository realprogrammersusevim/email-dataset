Content Management Is Key: Need a reason your boss should be sending you to Gnomedex? Some of the leading experts on content management solutions (those things we affectionately call blogs) will be sharing the future of blogging and how you can adapt it to both the way you do business and the way you communicate in general. Join Evan Williams and Doc Searls as they share pearls of wisdom on blogging, Linux and other open source applications that are changing our lives. If that's not enough incentive, remind the boss that THE Internet security guru, Steve Gibson, will be sharing his wisdom as well.

To all you Dream Theater fans out there, please accept my humblest of apologies. 
I mistakenly announced their break up in the last GnomeAudio section, causing 
quite a stir among a number of subscribers. In fact, they just released a double 
album this year and have been touring in support of that release. 
For today's false alarm, please make note of the tragedy that is the N'SYNC 
breakup (oh wait, that's just wishful thinking).

I know I've already carried on about my Kyocera 6035 phone, but this thing is 
awesome.  I've got all my contacts in one device. Web browsing is good - I'm 
sure it would be better on a color screen, like the 
Treo 270, but for what I'll need, 
this works well. I'm currently looking for an ssh client I can install, so that 
remote server logins will be possible. My one complaint is the base station's 
use of a serial connector instead of USB, but I suppose they were cutting costs. 

I'm also scoping out the 
Palm Markup Language 
(PML) standard for marking up Palm Docs, 
in an effort to make the GnomeTomes a little flashier. I've installed several of 
the files on my phone and while they are easy to read, have all the content 
organized, and function as useful tips for the various subjects, I'd like to add 
some minor tweaks to future tomes, so that they look even better for me and 
anyone else who reads them on their Palm.

TomeRaider v2.0 [1673k] W98/W2K/Pocket PC/Palm $25
http://www.tomeraider.com/


Of the formats Lockergnome uses for our GnomeTomes, TomeRaider is by far my 
favorite. Designed with a feel similar to CHM, the TR format is quite easy 
to read, as it places section titles in a pane separate from content, 
allowing you, the reader, to navigate through our tips (or anything else) 
with much greater ease than the linear format the other versions present. 
The Windows version of the software is truly designed with ease of use in 
mind. Creating ebooks for TomeRaider is a simple matter of combining a 
modified set of HTML tags with the  designation for page breaks. The 
only trick for Yankees like me is remembering that center is tagged centre 
in the software.

Triumph the dog is low-tech, he's not cute like the pets.com sock puppet, 
but he manages to maintain a twisted appeal to fans of lowbrow comedy. In 
this segment, Triumph makes a mockery of geeks standing in line for 
Episode II. Whether you've been one of those geeks yourself, or you've 
never understood why anyone would dress up and wait in line for a movie, 
you'll still find this film amusing. 10 minutes was more than necessary 
to get the point across, yet Triumph delivers enough one-liners 
throughout to keep you watching all the way to the end.

Classic jazz vocal styling, juxtaposing arrangements of contemporary 
pieces with arrangements of jazz standards. Combined with some 
beautiful piano arrangements, Heleen's voice is a thing of beauty. A 
Netherlands native,  who originally dreamed of saving the rainforests 
(at least according to her biography), her interpretation of American 
jazz standards and show tunes is more remarkable than most native 
English speaking vocalists. No world tour is currently scheduled, so 
you'll probably have to journey to Europe to see her in person, but 
for those of you living elsewhere in the world, the Internet makes a 
fabulous venue for experiencing Heleen  van den Hombergh's talent.

Aezay Caption Draw v1.0 [71k] W9X/NT/W2K/XP FREE
http://www.winamp.com/plugins/detail.jhtml?componentId=112660

Reminding me of creating captions for Webcam32, this application uses 
incomprehensible string values to display relevant info about Winamp 
songs in the Windows caption bar. List song names, time of day, 
playlist information, filenames, and a variety of other more obscure 
information. Changing caption colors is also doable within this 
plug-in. A set of hot keys makes controlling Winamp from your keyboard 
more functional, although you can't remap any of the keys.

The Man Who Wasn't There (R) 2001
Drama - 116min
Reviewer's Tilt (9)

Special DVD Features worth a look-Thornton and Coen Brothers Commentary

Much more film noir, than a movie trying to imitate film noir, The Man
Who Wasn't There captures the inevitable hopelessness of the genre. Ed
Crane (Billy Bob Thornton) is the archetype everyman. A barber by trade,
Crane represents the individual in society. He hears everything, but
truly knows nothing. Everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by
the retelling. He gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations.
Left to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him, Crane
develops an indifference to it all. When a snake oil sales man slithers
into town, Crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish
the punishers.  As indifferent as Crane appears, he is no match for the
amorality of fate. As much as fate is indifferent in its wrath, however,
so is it artistic in its execution. That is what makes our lives so
entertaining. Fate doles ultimate justice, but never as expected. The
Man Who Wasn't There is truly a Kafkaesque tale of an individual's year
to turn against the tide of inevitability. Atypical of cuter, more
recent Coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their earlier
noir works like Blood Simple and Miller's Crossing. Frances McDormand
does an outstanding job making as Crane's selfish wife and James
Gandolfini exudes boorishness as Doris' boss. The real outstanding
performances, however, rest with the supporting cast. Tony Shalhoub, as
pompus attorney Freddy Riedenschneider and  Jon Polito as the snake oil
salesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their
characters. The black and white cinematography by Roger Deakins also
impresses and precisely underscores the bleakness of Crane's life and
the monochromatic nature of fate.
