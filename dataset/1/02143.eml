Reader Jack Macdonald has some advice for you would-be bards in the audience: 

"You mention Karaoke being featured at Gnomedex and you 
might want to point out to other Gnomies that they could 
practice their Karaoke on my Red Hot 
Karaoke Page site. There are the words and music for 
more than 1100 songs available on the site and by 
downloading the Yamanha Midiplug (a link is provided) they 
can even change the key of the song to suit their voice 
range as well as speed up or slow down the music to their 
taste. In other words, to have the same experience as they 
would have with professional Karaoke equipment but at no 
extra cost! At this price (zero) a lot of gnomies going to 
Gnomedex could be singing up a storm by being properly 
prepared for your Karaoke."

Travel day on Wednesday as I head down to Ankeny, Iowa to 
help out a former co-worker and avid Gnomie with some server 
and networking stuff. The tough part is remembering 
everything I'll need. It never fails, though. I always, 
always, always forget something. I can make lists two weeks 
in advance and I'll end up 30 miles down the road with a 
handprint on my forehead when I come to the realization that 
I left something important behind. What will it be this 
time, I wonder? I'll let you know on Thursday.




See You in August,Randy Nieland

Forwarding to Internet Address Fails
http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;EN-US;q181636
Client inquires about the possibility of forwarding all 
internal and Internet email to his AOL mailbox when he's out 
of the office, and I figure it's going to be a piece of 
cake. He recently acquired a new phone through Verizon along 
with web access and a tie into his AOL mailbox, which was 
the driving force behind this request. What I found was that 
Internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding 
rule, but none of the internal Exchange email was being sent 
out to the Internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to 
be included in the rule. As it happens, this is due to a 
default configuration option on the Exchange 5.5 server that 
prevents automatic replies/forwards from being sent to the 
Internet using the Exchange Internet Mail Service. A quick 
configuration change and restart of IMS will put things 
right.

Stop the Presses
http://www.wininformant.com/Articles/Index.cfm?ArticleID=25802
... The CD presses, that is. Microsoft has given in to 
the greater good and delayed Windows 2000 Service Pack 3 
indefinitely. Sure, it's mildly disappointing, but I applaud 
the move. Instead of trying to downplay the previously 
identified problems with Microsoft Installer (MSI) 2.0, the 
service pack will be put on ice until the issues are 
straightened out. Here's a quote for you... Good job, 
Microsoft.

Windows XP System File Checker
Dean Truax mentioned the System File Checker as a 
possible solution to my Windows Media Player problem under 
Windows XP, and I did indeed run through it prior to 
attempting an in-place upgrade, obviously with no 
improvement. It's still worth a mention, however, in case 
you're not familiar with what it's there for. As you're 
probably aware, XP contains a file protection scheme that 
will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or 
altered in any way, ensuring that XP is kept in a stable 
state. Sometimes this system can get a little out of whack, 
and the SFC is meant to restore order. Note that any 
hotfixes and other Microsoft-provided updates will be left 
in place since they properly update the DLL Cache that is 
used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has 
been messed with. To access the SFC, simply launch a command 
prompt and type "SFC" to display a list of options.

Consider This
Forwarded by JW

http://www.computerworld.com/securitytopics/security/story/0,10801,72519,00.html
The next time you have a face-to-face with your elected 
representatives, you might want to start asking about their 
opinions on technology laws that are being proposed left and 
right. Holding a public office seems to be introducing brain 
death more frequently considering proposals by Senator Fritz 
Hollings and now LA congressman Howard Berman. If Mr. Berman 
gets his way, companies may very well be allowed to hack 
into your systems without proof of provocation in order to 
ensure that you are using their software according to the 
stated rules. Mind you, if they cause colateral damage or 
upset other systems, there isn't thing one you can do in 
return. Nope, they'll have legal protection. This garbage is 
seriously getting scary. If you think it won't be abused, 
consider the case of Dimitry Skylarov when he publicly 
pointed out eBook security problems with Adobe's software 
and was promptly thrown in jail for his trouble under the 
authority of the Digital Millenium Copyright Act. He was 
eventually released, but that doesn't make it any more 
right.
