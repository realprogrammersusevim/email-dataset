Yes and I understand that argument, however.
Sometimes I find that if I don't try to write code in the least space
possible or for example become lazy and say

--Bad style
Bool q;

If(q)
	When I should say
If(q==true)
	
Or

--Bad optimization

int a;
a=some_function();
if(a) <--which apparently works but is 'bad coding style'.

That's what I mean about letting the programming tools take care
of the coding.... it's considered 'bad' apparently.

Or for example say you are writing a loop that says

For(a=0;a>
