Battered stocks regain ground
Led by a surge in chip titan Intel, beaten-down technology shares rose Thursday.

Despite a Merrill Lynch downgrade of Yahoo to "reduce/sell", the Internet portal rose after posting better-than-expected second-quarter results and also helped lift the sector. CNET's Tech index gained 29.87 points, or 3.11 percent, to close at 995.16. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index tacked on 28.42 points, or 2.11 percent, to close at 1,374.43--after hitting a five-year low Wednesday.

Broader markets were mixed amid news wholesale prices rose slightly and drug firm Bristol-Myers Squibb is being probed by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 12.0 points, or 0.14 percent, to close at 8,801.5. The S&P; 500 added 6.9 points, or 0.75 percent, to close at 927.37, after it too reached a five-year low Wednesday.

Shareholders sue PayPal, eBay 
The PayPal-eBay merger has hit an early snag: Two shareholder lawsuits have been filed against the companies seeking to block the deal.
The lawsuits, each filed in Delaware Chancery Court earlier this week on behalf of PayPal shareholders, charge that the deal represents a breach of the companies' fiduciary duty to those shareholders and that the price eBay is paying for PayPal is unfair and inadequate, the companies said in separate regulatory filings on Thursday.EBAY INC 60.38 2.63% 

SAP cuts forecast, shows Q2 loss

Merrill Lynch downgrades Yahoo in report 7/11/02 
Analysts Justin Baldauf and Tim Gernitis cut their intermediate-term rating on the Internet giant from "neutral" to "reduce/sell" and their long-term rating from "strong buy" to "neutral" after seeing Yahoo's second-quarter results. Although the results look solid at first, Baldauf and Gernitis say Yahoo's growth was driven entirely by new initiatives. They also argue the firm's improved outlook seems driven completely by the Overture deal extension. Eventually, these initiatives will result in much lower growth rates, the analysts say. They argue Yahoo's stock price isn't supported by the firm's fundamentals.YAHOO INC 12.92 5.99%
