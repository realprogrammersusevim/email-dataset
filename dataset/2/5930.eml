Dear Respectful One,
 
Permit me to inform you our desire of going into business relationship wi=
th
you. I know you might be surprised on recieving this mail from us due to
we have not met before.
 
By brief introduction , I am Nelison and Linda, my younger sister. We are=

native of  bouake district in republic of Cote d'Ivoire. We are the child=
ren
of late Chief and Mrs. David Kamara, who was assasinated by the rebels in=

our home town during the recent political crises of 19th sept.2003. Until=
l
the death of our parents, they were very wealthy Cocoa/cafe farmers & exp=
orter
based in abidjan the capital city of coted'ivoire.
Before their death in a private specialist hospital, my father called me
on his bed side and secretly confided to me the sum of US$10.5 million do=
llars
which he deposited in one of the banks in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire for onwa=
rdly
 transfer abroad for investment on his proposed cocoa processing company
through an assistance of a foreign partner.
 
My father also told me his intension to invest part of the money in colla=
boration
with oil companies in countries like Libya, America or Europe, but unfort=
unately
he died the way he did without accomplishing his objective as a result of=

the rebels attack.
Having know that he will not survive from the injuries he sustained as a
result of the wounds and pains inflinched on him by the rebels, then advi=
sed
me to quickly and hurriedly go into his personal underground safe in our
family villa and take the documents covering the deposit in the bank and
look for a true and trustworthy foreigner assist us as partner to front t=
o
the bank as our late parents partner abroad for immediate transfer of the=

money for investment in any lucrative business of our chioce for our futu=
re
welfare.
 
 
Upon the instruction and advice by my father before he finally died, I th=
erefore
request your assistance to help us for onward transfer of the money to yo=
ur
country for  investment partnership with you in any lucrative business in=

your country.  We have agreed to give you 20% of the total sum immediatel=
y
the transfer  is made, while 2.5% also will be set aside to cover all the=

expenses you  might incure on the process.
 
Upon your acceptance to our proposal, kindly get back to me through the a=
bove
email address so that we can discuss further process on the ways to  achi=
eve
this golden success together.
 
Note, we are still in the refugee camp Yamussoukro, Cote d'Ivoire, We nee=
d
 your urgent attention to this mail because we want to leave here for a 
better future with you abroad, as the rebels had killed our parent and al=
so
have taken over my home town as their operational territory, we  look for=
ward
to you to help us with most urgency and honesty.
 
Expecting your reply soon.
Best Regard and God Bless you.
