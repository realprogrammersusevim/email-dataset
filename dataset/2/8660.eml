Dear Friend,
                              ASSISTANCE

Kindly allow me the modesty of introducing myself. I am GEORGE KABILA,the=
 son
of the former head of state/president of Congo-Kinshasha (then called Zai=
re)
Mr.Laurent Desire Kabila.

I am contacting you in other to ask for your assistance on this confident=
ial
Business proposal with full financial benefit for both of us.

Before I go into further details please be informed that I am writing wit=
hout
any other person(s)
pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this transaction.

Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained all through.

I have the sum of USD20.7Million from a secret sale of Diamond by my fath=
er
before he was assassinated by one of his body guard (Rashid) on January 1=
6th
2001, which I will like you to receive on my behalf due to Security reaso=
ns, as
my narration below will explain.

But before I continue be well informed that your share in this transactio=
n has
been calculated as 15% of the total sum of USD$20.7M, 5% for expenses and=
 the
rest for my family and I.
My father as a real African traditionalist was a polygamist thereby havin=
g
married to so many wives, and my mother being the second wife of my fathe=
r, My
step brother Joseph, who is currently the  president of my country, is th=
e son
of the first wife and he does not have any knowledge about this deal.

Already president Joseph is using his power to colonize all the money and
private property, which my late father left behind for the entire family.

Now my mother and I are left with nothing in the inheritance of my late
father's wealth. Our situation is seriously critical that we need your
assistance to help us receive this money overseas for proper investment.

Let me quickly assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free because=
 the
diamond sales are packaged from  the unset in a pattern that shows no dir=
ect
trace or linkage with us (Kabila family). At present the money is deposit=
ed and
is secured with a holding company under deposit account.

I am waiting for your swift and favourable response, and in case you have=
 any
question(s), do not hesitate to contact me.

My alternative e mail address is : gkabila@hispavista.com

Best Regards.


George Kabila.
