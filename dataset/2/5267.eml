Dear sir

I wish to solicit your help in migrating to your
country and investing my funds.
Briefly, I am a Sierra Leonean National and the wife
of late Dr SIMON LAMINE.
Until his death, my husband was the General overseer
of the Diamond and Gold Mining Corporation in Kanema,
Sierra Leone. On April 6 2000 the military forces
loyal to the Government of Ahmed TIJAN KABBAH invaded
the Diamond and Gold mine and assassinated my husband,
mistaking him for his brother MIKE LAMINE who is the
deputy to the leader of the revolutionary United
Front (RUF ) FODAY SANKOH.

When the news reached me, I hurried gathered some
valuables in our family villa and escaped for my dear
life in the company of my only son PETERS.

Among the valuables was a file that contained details
of a Deposit my husband made in a security company in
Europe. He deposited US$ 15.5 M  contained
in 1 Trunk Box in the name of our son PETERS as
containing family valuables. He did not disclose the
real contents of the box to the security company.
Rather, he declared the deposit as Family Valuables
for security reasons. This is the money he made from
the sale of Gold and diamonds during his time as the
General overseer.
We need your sincere assistance to move this funds out from the 
security
company IN EUROPE for investment
in your country as we cannot invest here due to its
nearess to our country and the war still going on
there. Besides, our Refugee Status here cannot help
matters for us. We also ask you to scout for a viable
and lucrative business, so that we can invest wisely.

We have it in mind to give your 30 % of the total sum
(15.5 million US Dollars), and 20% share in any
investment we will embark upon if you assist us. We
will also set aside 5% of the funds for ancillary
expenses which you will make in course of this
transaction- air tickets and handling expenses etc.

This fortune we have revealed to you should remain
confidential as it only you who we have told about it.
pleaselet me have your phone/fax numbers for more detials.

Note that this transaction is risk free.
May God Bless you as you assist us.
Yours Sincerely ,

MRS ELISABETH / PETERS LAMINE
