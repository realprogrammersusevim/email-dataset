SANDTON, JOHANNESBURG,
SOUTH AFRICA

ATTENTION: DEAR  SIR



              HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL

  With due respect trust and humility, I write you this
proposal, which I believe it will be a great interst
to you.I found your contact while I was doing a
private research on the internet for a reliable and
capable foreign partner that will assist my family and
me. That's why I contacted you. I am MRS.ROSE SONDO
the wife of MR.MICHAEL SONDO of Zimbabwe.
  During the current war against famers in Zimbabwe and
from the support of our president ROBERT MUGABE to
claim all the white owned farms in our country, all
the white and black farmers were ordered to surrender
their farms to his party members and his followers. My
husband who was one of the best farmers in our country
and treasurer of the farmer's CO-pperation did not
suport his idea and so the party members invaded my
husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm,
Killed my husband and made away with a lot of items in
my husband's farm.
    After the death of my husband, i and my childern
decided to move out of Zimbabwe because our lives were
in danger with the money that my husband kept in his
hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the
safe is US$24.2M (TWENTY FOUR.TWO MILLION UNITED SATES
DOLLAR) and we decided to code the money and move to
the Republic of SOUTH AFRICA where we deposited the
money in a SECURITY COMPANY as a valuable item.So i
decided to make contact with an overseas firm whom
will assist me to move this money out of South Africa,
because we are asylum seekers here in South Africa.
   So if you consider this proppsal, we have agreed to
give you 30% of the total sum for helping us to move
this money out to your country and 10% will be mapped
out for expenses both of us may incur during this
transaction and 60% Will be for me and family to
invest in your country. All i want is for you to
furnish me with all your banking details and your
personal phone and fax numbers for easy communication.
You can contact me on the above Tel and e-mail
address.
  NOTE: That this transaction is 100% risk free and
absolutely confidential.Then if you are intrested to
help me and children you will contact my only son
MAGIZAR SONDO with the above e-mail
Thanks and God bless you.
Best Regard,
MRS:ROSE SONDO.
FOR THE FAMILY.
