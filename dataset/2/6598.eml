ATTENTION

           PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL 
Having consulted with my colleagues and based on the information Gathered from 
the Nigerian Chambers Of Commerce And Industry, I have the privilege to 
request your assistance to transfer the sum of (15,500.000.00) FIFITEEN 
MILLION, FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS, into your accounts. 

The above sum resulted from an over-invoiced contract, executed, Commissioned 
and paid for about  three years (3) ago by a foreign  contractor.

This action was however intentional and since then the fund has been in a 
suspense account at The Central Bank Of Nigeria Apex Bank. We are now ready to 
transfer the fund overseas and that is where you Come in. It is important to 
inform you that as civil servants, we are Forbidden to operate a foreign 
account; that is why we require your  assistance. 

The total sum will be shared as follows: 65% for us, 30% for you and 5% for 
local and international expenses incidental to the transfer.

The transfer is risk free on both sides. I am an accountant with the Nigerian 
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). If you find this  proposal 
acceptable,we shall require the following documents:(1) Your banker name and 
address (2) Your private telephone and fax numbers ? for confidentiality and 
easy communication. (c) Your full name and address.

Alternatively we will furnish you with an application form which you will file 
and apply directly to the Central Bank of Nigeria, where this money was 
deposited, along with a breakdown explaining, comprehensively what we require 
of you. 

The business will take us (14) working days to accomplish.
 
Await your urgent response.

Yours Sincerely

Rev. Dr. THomas Ella.
