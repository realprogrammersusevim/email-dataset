Dear Friend=2C 

My name is Mrs=2E Xiao Mei and I am a bank manager of a reputable bank in China=2E I would respectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail confidential and respect the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail=2E I contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed of this communication=2E 

The subject in questions was a client with my bank and until his demise he maintained an investment in millions of dollars=2C which has since reached its maturity=2E The subject maintained a discrete relationship with us and never nominated a legatee to his investment=2E At the time of his demise he was yet to sign the mandate card and he remained in testate=2E It is ethical that his investment with us be confiscated by government and to be reverted to treasury but not quite=2C it would be diverted and embezzled by insincere executives=2E 

Consequently=2C what I propose is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to the deceased=2E Acting in this capacity really is simple=2C as I will explain in detail to you when I get your response=2E 

However=2C I wish to appeal to you not to be vindictive if my proposal does not appeal to you=2C just delete it and forget I ever contacted you with this proposal=2E Ordinarily I would not do this but all humans have needs and there are circumstances that you would get to understand better should we work together on this project=2E 

Awaiting your urgent reply through my alternative email xmei=5F2001=40126=2Ecom =3Cmailto=3Axmei=5F2001=40126=2Ecom=3E for security reasons=2E

Yours Sincerely=2C
Xiao Mei
