Attention,

Please accept my sincere apologizes if my email does not meet your
business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as Mr.David
Perry, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known bank, here
in London, England.

One of our accounts, with holding balance of 15,000,000 (Fifteen Million
Pounds Sterling) has been dormant and last operated some years ago. From
my investigations and confirmation, the owner of the said account, a
foreigner who died on Wednesday, July 13, 2005; Posted: 1:02 p.m. EDT
(17:02GMT).He was among by London bomb victims identified.You can go
through the website,

WWW.CNN.COM/LONDONTERROR

Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this
money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the
existence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from
the National
Immigration also states that he was single on entry into the UK.

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is
legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or
any other illegal act and also I am going to secure all the legal
documents that will acompany the fund to your account to prove that the
fund is an inheritance fund,you should also know that inheritance fund
dose not prohibited in any Country once the beneficiary have all the legal
documents to prove the legality of the fund.

On your interest, Let me hear from you URGENTLY.

Warm Regards,
Mr. Davis Perry.
