               ( REMITTANCE OF $5 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS CONFIDENTIAL IS THE 
CASE")
Compliment Of The Season,

  On a very good day. I am (HASSAN MUSA),The Head of file Department in 
African development bank (ADB).I got your contact from tourist search.
When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and 
reliability to champion this businees opportunitywhen i prayed to Allah  
about you.In my department we discovered and abandoned Five million U.S.A  
dollars (us$5m) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer 
who died along with his entire family on (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane 
crash.

  Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next 
of  kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relationto the deceased as  
indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all
his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

  It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my 
department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release 
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to
the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is 
comingfor it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed bill.

  The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained  
unclamed after seven years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this  
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a  
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of 
this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision 
of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the 
  business and 60 % would be f or me and my woman colleague. There after i  
will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages  
indicated.

  Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as 
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of 
the deceased  indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your 
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication
and location where the  money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I 
will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail 
to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you 
should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been
made for thetransfer.

You should contact me on my number 00226-7650 9277, immediately as soon as 
you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.
Yours faithfully,
HASSAN MUSA
.
POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to 
  move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank. As you  
finish reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well  
over this business.
