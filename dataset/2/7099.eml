My name is MR JOHN KELU from LIBERIA, a Country in WEST 
AFRICA. I am in a hide out now in BENIN REPUBLIC, 
a neighboring Country in the same West African. I have 
Large sum of money for INVESTMENT. The money is in 
Millions of U.S. dollars. I need Your help urgently for 
both SAFE KEEPING and INVESTING this money in your country. 
I cannot move about freely now for reasons i will explain 
to you later.

My Uncle is MR JOHN Y. WINPOE. He was a former DEPUTY 
MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY in LIBERIA. My Uncle made
this money from DIAMOND BUSINESS while he was a DEPUTY 
MINISTER OF NATIONAL SECURITY. 
He was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then 
PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA (PRESIDENT CHARLES TAYLOR) from office.
Without trial, he was killed by Charles Taylor. You can 
verify this from LIBERIAN EMBASSY in your country. You can 
also check in some of the international news papers posted 
in the web sites bellow:

You are one of the three email contacts given to me by a 
Cyber Cafe' operator on my request for a foreign contact. 
She did not tell me your name or country of origin. Though 
I did not tell her why I needed the contact of any foreigner.

Because of the urgent and confidential nature of this
business, you are advised to keep everything secret for 
now. If you are interested in doing this business with me, 
kindly reply immediately to my two email Addresses:

After that, i will send you all the details about this business.
You may if you so wish call me any time on my satellite 
phone:  +88216-46689736. This is a THURAYA satellite phone. 
You can get THURAYA TELEPHONE easily by calling with AT&T,

advice you.

As from Tuesday (11/11/2003), I will be in the city.
Only then can you get me on My BENIN REPUBLIC telephone
