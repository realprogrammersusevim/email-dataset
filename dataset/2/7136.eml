Attention:

With warm hearts I offer my friendship, and my greetings, and I hope
This letter meets you in good time. It will be surprising to you to
Receive this proposal from me since you do not know me personally.
and due to the rate of scam mails being sent around the world you 
might find it difficult to trust anyone,but please do not regrad this mail as =
such as i have all genuine documentsand facts backing my claims,and also a =
reputable security and financial institution in europe is were my funds is =
deposited.

However, I am sincerely seeking your confidence in this =
transaction(TRANSFER), which I propose with my free mind and as a person of =
integrity.

My name is HAROLD.A.MBEKI, the son of LATE STEVE ZHIRI MBEKI,
One of the most popular farmers from Zimbabwe, who was murdered in the
Land dispute in my country.As led by my instinct, I decided to contact you =
through email, after searching for Contacts via the internet, as it is the =
only means I can contact anybody since I am cutting off ties with Zimbabwe =
for now. I apologize if this is not acceptable to you.

The purpose of this letter is to seek your most needed assistance in a
Business venture i intend to go into as soon as i get out this funds.

Due to the land and political problems in Zimbabwe, and President Robert =
Mugabe's introduction of new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white =
farmers and the few rich black farmers,all white farmers were asked to =
surrender their farms to the government for re-distribution and infact to his =
political party members and my father though black was the treasury of the =
farmers  association and a strong Member of an opposition party that did not =
support the president's idea.

He then ordered his party members and the police under his pay row to
Invade my father's farm and burn down everything in the farm. They Killed my =
father and took away a lot of items from his farm.

After the death of my father, our local pastor and a close friend of my
Father Reverened Theophilus Nnamni ,handed us over will documents with =
instructions from my father That we should leave Zimbabwe incase anything =
happen to him.

The will documents have a certificate of deposit, Airway bill confirming cash =
Deposit totalling Twelve million five hundred thousand united state 
dollars. [$12.5m] kept in custody for us in a security company unknown to 
the company (BRITISH INVESTMENT TRUST SECURITY COMPANY (NETHERLANDS) 
that the content is money hence it was deposited as PERSONAL BELONGINGS.

This money was deposited with this Private Security Company for
Safety and security reasons, and was to be used for the purchase
Of land, new machines and chemicals establishment of new farms in
Botswana.

This violent and barbaric act by Mugabe has since led to the death of
My beloved mother and kid sister and other innocent lives.I was continually =
threatened to abandon my inheritance from my father
After he was murdered. I resisted for a while, but when the danger
Became unbearable, and I survived two murder attempts, I fled Zimbabwe
With the help of my father's close friend Mr. John Casahans from
Australia also a farmer who was leaving in Zimbabwe with us but left
With his family following this ugly development I have tried to reach
Him but all to no avail.

I am currently staying in the Netherlands where I am seeking political
Asylum. In fact my decision to come here to seek asylum, is because
the security company from South Africa, has a branch here, I have
Contacted them to move the safe deposit from their office in
Johannesburg to The affiliate office here in Amsterdam The Netherlands
which they have finally confirmed to me that the funds has sucessfully 
being transfered to their branch office in AMSTERDAM NETHERLANDS.
and that they are waiting further directives from me before they effect the =
transfer tomy nominated bank account.but due to my refugee status its being =
difficult for me moving this Money. Since the law of Netherlands prohibits a =
refugee (asylum Seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any =
financial Transaction, this is why I am seeking a genuine and reliable =
Partner and friend, whose account this money can be transferred after the =
consignment,hence your involvement in this venture.and that would be with the =
assistance of Advocate Smith.E.Fevinn
who has his chambers in DEN HAGG,in the NETHERLANDS who has agreed to stand =
by me till my funds is released, after hearing all my ordeal and verifying my =
claims from the security company.

You have to understand that this decision taken by me is a very big
And brave one, and it entrusts my future in your hands, as a result of
the safe keeping of this money.

If you accept to assist me, all I want you to do for me, is to assist
With arrangements to claim the deposit from the security company from
their office here in The Netherlands, as it has now been transferred
>From Johannesburg, South Africa to their branch here. The company will
be legally informed of you representing me.

For your assistance, I have two options for you. Firstly you can
Choose to have 20% of the money for your assistance, and helping me
Open an account for the money to be deposited here, or you can go into
Partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money
in your country.Whichever the option you want, please to notify me in
Your reply.

I have also set aside 1 % of the total sum $12.5M for all kinds of
Expenses that come our way in the process of this transaction, and 4%
For Charity donation. If you prefer to accept the 20% for
Your moral and financial assistance then the balance will be left
in the account here for me.

Please note that this 1% is not with me at the moment but shall be 
deducted from The total contract sum as soon as the money finally hits your =
nominated account.because it is from this i% that i have to settle the =
barrister.

Finally I want you to maintain absolute secrecy for the purpose of
This transaction.as i do not want anything that would jeopardise this
transfer,all my life soley depend on this funds to start up a better life as =
i have no one else to fall back to.as i have lost all i have gotten back =
home.You can verify my story at
