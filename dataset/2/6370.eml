My name is Ahmed Mustafa, Principal Partner in Ahmed
Mustafa LawChambers, London, UK. I use to be a
personal attorney to Mr. MohammedSaibi who was the
chairman of Algosaibi Diving and Marine Services
inDhahran, Saudi Arabia. Mr. Saibi died late last year
of heart attack atthe ripe age of 79 years.

Mr. Mohammed Saibi a Saudi Arabia Philanthropist,
before he died, madea Will in my law firm stating that
$5.2M (Five million, Two HundredThousand U.S. dollars
only) should be donated to any charity home of
ourchoice overseas as his last contribution to
humanity when it becameobvious that he will not be
alive for too long. His only son, RasheedSaibi and his
entire family has no knowledge of this. However, I am
verymuch aware that he has left enough wealth that
will last his generation alife time. 

The true situation at the moment is that the said
amount of money wasdeposited with a security company
only to be paid out to a charity home.The charity
home/organization would have to be picked by my law
office.This implies that you will stand as the
beneficiary to this Will so thatthe funds could be
processed and transferred to your account if you
areready and in a position to assist me. You do not
need to have a charityorganization, all you need do is
to declare your interest and showseriousness. The
paper works to present you as the benficiary will be
doneby me.

I am particularly interested in securing this money
from the Securitycompany because they have issued a
notice instructing us to produce thebeneficiary of
this Will as soon as possible, else the account would
bemade dormant since Mr. Saibi was ill for a long
period of time before hisdemise.

If you are interested in assisting me, I will give you
30% of theentire funds after paying taxes due to your
government and expenses duringthe course of this deal
withdrawn from it. The balance will be minealthough I
intend to send some of it to a charity organization.

I urge you to contact me immediately for further
details if you aresatisfied with my proposition and
feel you are in a position to assist me.Bearing in
mind the confidential nature of this transaction, I
will prefer you respond through mail.

Yours faithfully,

Mr. Ahmed Mustafa Esq.
