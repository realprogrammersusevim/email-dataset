        From Aiash Kone,

  =20
  Dear Father & mother
  =20
  I am Aisha Kone 22 years old and the only daughter  =20
of my late parents Mr.and Mrs.Kone.My father was a highly reputable busnn=
ess magnet-(a cocoa merchant)who operated in the pital of Ivory coast dur=
ing his days. It is sad to say that he passed away mysteriously in France=
 during one of his business trips abroad ,12th.Feb 002.Though his sudden =
death was linked or rather suspected to have been masterminded by an uncl=
e of his who travelled with him at that time. But God knows the truth!
  =20
  My mother died when I was just 4 years old,and since then my father too=
k me so special. Before his death on Febuary 12 2002 he called the secret=
ary who accompanied him to the hospital and told her that he had a sum of=
 7 000,000 US DOLLARS (Seven) MILLION U.S DOLLARS)kept in a security comp=
any in (ABIDJAN),Cote D'ivoire,
  =20
  He also said that the security company does not know the content of the=
 safe Box.He decleared it as family treasure,He also explained to him tha=
t it was because of this wealth that he was poisoned by his business asso=
ciates, That I should seek for a foreign partner in a country of my choic=
e where I will transfer this money to and use it for investment purposes.
  =20
  I want you to assist me in clearing this box(fund)from the security com=
pany and then tranfer the fund into your account overseas as a beneficiar=
y of the fund,and also use it for an investment purpose. I am just 22 yea=
rs old and a university undergraduate and really don't know what to do.No=
w I want an account overseas where I can transfer this funds.
  =20
  This is because I have suffered a lot of set backs as a result of inces=
sant political crisis here in Ivory coast.The death of my father actually=
 brought sorrow to my life.Dearest one,I am in a sincere desire of your h=
umble assistance in this regards Your suggestions and ideas will be highl=
y regarded.
  =20
  Now permit me to ask these few questions:-
1. Can you honestly help me as your daughter=20
2. Can I completely trust you?
3. What percentage of the total amount in question
will be good for you after the money is in your
account?
  =20
  Please,Consider this and get back to me as soon as
possible.
 =20
Thank you so much.
My sincere regards,
Miss.Aisha Kone.
