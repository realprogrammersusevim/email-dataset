URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL
Engineer Richard Sullivan
Shell Petroleum South Africa.
REPLY VIA: richardsullivan008@walla.com



Greeting to you.

I am Richard Sullivan, a director of contracts evaluation and
implemention department of Shell Petroleoum,South Africa. I am married
with
Children
and hold degrees in economics and business studies.

I require urgently your unreserved assistance in providing me with a
safe and reliable bank account with full details, where I can transfer
the
sum of $20.5M (Twenty million five hundred thousand United States of
American
Dollars) The purpose of the transfer is to take care of my retirement
by investing in a viable business you might deem fit to advise.

This sum of money was generated as a result of over-invoiced contracts
awarded by my colleagues and I, and I have arranged for the money to be
remitted out through a reliable expatriate partner whom I can present
as the beneficiary, as my present status and financial resources will
not be
sufficient for me to handle the transfer successfully without the
financial assistance of a reliable foreign partner.

I got your profile from our chamber of commerce and it is with business
trust that I write to request, you partner with us to facilitate the
transfer of this money to your nominated bank account for our mutual
benefits.

Note that 20% will go to you for your efforts and your contribution, 5%
is for miscelleneous expenses incurred by both parties, and 75% will be
shared between me and colleagues which will be use for business
investment
in
your country under your supervision.

Please if you are interested kindly send to me immediately the
underlisted:
1. Name to be used as beneficiary and beneficiarys address.
2. Your private and confidential telephone/ fax number(s)and Cell
phone.
3. Your bank name,address,bank Account Number and Telephone/fax
number(s). Contact me via my alternative e- mail:
richardsullivan008@walla.com
as you receive my mail. I hope to conclude this business within the
next
fourteen- (14) working days.Looking forward to your anticipated and
urgent positive response.

Thanks indeed,

Engr.Richard Sullivan
