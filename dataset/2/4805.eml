COMPLIMENTS OF THE DAY MA/SIR.

I am JOHN MOKA the chief accountant of Amalgamated Bank of South
Africa (ABSA). There is an account opened in this bank in 1999 and since=20
2001 nobody has operated on this account again. After going through some =
old=20
files in the records, I discovered that if I do not remit this money out=20
urgently it would be forfeited for nothing. The owner of this account is =
Mr.=20
Morris Thompson, a foreigner, Business Man and a miner at Kruger Gold=20
Company, a Geologist by profession and he died since 2000. Ever then no=20
other person knows this account or anything concerning it, the account ha=
s=20
no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that this=20
company does not know anything about this account and the money involved =
is=20
One hundred and Thirty Six Million United States Dollars (US$ 136 Million=
). =20
I want
us to first transfer US$ 36 Million from this money into your safe
overseas account before the rest. I am only contacting you as a foreigner=
=20
because this money cannot be approved to a local bank here, but can only =
be=20
approved to any foreign account because the money is in United States=20
Dollars and the former owner Mr. Morris Thompson is a foreigner too. I kn=
ow=20
that this message will come to you as surprise as we don=92t know ourselv=
es=20
before.

We will sign an agreement, but be sure that it is real and a genuine
business. You can view the web site bellow for more information on our la=
te=20
client.

I only got your contact information from my secretary who operates
computer; with believe in God that you will never let me down in this=20
business, considering my position as a public servant. You are the only=20
person that I have contacted in this business; so please reply urgently s=
o=20
that I will inform you the next step to take immediately. Send also your=20
private telephone and fax numbers including the full details of your acco=
unt=20
to be used for the deposit. I want us to meet face-to-face and sign a=20
binding agreement to bind us together so that you can receive this money=20
into your account where the fund will be safe. And I will fly to your=20
country for withdrawal and sharing and other investment.

Meanwhile, I am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner=
=20
with foreign account and foreign beneficiary. I need your full co-operati=
on=20
to make this work fine because the management is ready to approve this=20
payment to any foreigner who has correct information of this account, whi=
ch=20
I will give to you as soon as you indicate your sincerity to co-operate w=
ith=20
me, and capability to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust=20
according to my instruction and advice for our mutual benefit because thi=
s=20
opportunity may never come again in my life. I need a truthful and God=20
fearing person in this business because I don=92t want to make a mistake =
so I=20
need your strong assurance and trust. With my position in the office I do=
n=92t
want anything that will jeopardize my job so I advice that we should make=
=20
secrecy and confidentiality our primary working condition, bearing in min=
d=20
that I am a public servant. I will also use my position and influence to=20
effect legal approvals and onward transfer of this money to your account=20
with appropriate clearance forms of the ministries and foreign exchange=20
department.


At the conclusion of this business, you will be giving 25% of the total
amount, 70% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties mi=
ght=20
have incurred the process of the transfer. I look forward to your
earliest reply.

Yours sincerely,
JOHN MOKA
CONFIDENTIAL
