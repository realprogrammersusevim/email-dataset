From: Mrs. Susan Shabangu.<br>
<br>
Greetings to you,<br>
<br>
With warm heart I offer my friendship, and greetings,<br>
and I hope this mail meets you in good time. However<br>
strange or surprising this contact might seem to you<br>
as we have not met personally or had any dealings in<br>
the past, I humbly ask that you take due consideration<br>
of its importance and the immense benefit it will be<br>
to you.<br>
<br>
After careful consideration with my children, we<br>
resolved to contact you for your most needed<br>
assistance in this manner. I duly apologize <br>
for infringing on your privacy, if this contact is not<br>
acceptable to you, as I make this proposal to you as a<br>
person of integrity.<br>
<br>
First and foremost I wish to introduce myself properly<br>
to you. My name is Mrs. Susan Shabangu, mother of<br>
three and the Deputy Minister of Minerals and Energy <br>
of The Republic of South Africa for seven years <br>
running as you will find in the link <br>
below: http://www.gov.za/gol/gcis_profile.jsp?id=3D1066 <br>
<br>
 <br>
I will now give you a general overview of the<br>
situation. When I was sworn in as Deputy Minister of<br>
Minerals and Energy in 1996, with my influence, my<br>
husband Mr. Ndelebe Simon Shabangu a very successful<br>
businessman was awarded several contracts in my<br>
ministry and had direct dealings with foreign<br>
investors in this field. Due to my political<br>
status, I was not involved in my husbands business<br>
which was very vast and successful. My beloved husband<br>
died whilst on an official trip to Trinidad <br>
and Tobago in February 2001.<br>
<br>
When my husband died, I was contacted as next of kin<br>
by a private security firm in Europe to come forth<br>
with the Certificate of Deposit and claim a safety<br>
deposit my husband has in their Vault in his name. At <br>
that time, my children and I did not have an idea<br>
where the Certificate might be. We then instructed the<br>
security firm to continue holding the safety deposit<br>
until further instructions from me. Whilst preparing<br>
for the second remembrance of my beloved husband, I<br>
was going through his library collection and to my<br>
astonishment I discovered a Certificate <br>
of Deposit for the safety deposit with this private<br>
security firm, and other documents relating to the<br>
safety deposit in a book. The safety deposit<br>
which is a trunk, is stocked with hard currency (US<br>
Dollars) totalling $10,000,000 which was generated<br>
from cash payments from his business associates in the<br>
diamond trade from Antwerp, Belgium.<br>
<br>
Though I knew my late husband was in the diamond<br>
business, I did not have the knowledge that he moved<br>
funds in cash. This has came as a shock to me and my<br>
children, and we have decided to have this fund<br>
invested immediately in commercial and residential<br>
properties abroad as well as profitable ventures, as<br>
any member of my family cannot hold such a huge<br>
amount in our name due to my political status, hence<br>
we sincerely propose to you to render us your most<br>
needed assistance in this regard.<br>
<br>
If you agree to render us your assistance, your role<br>
in this project will be to act on my behalf as a<br>
trustee to receive the safety deposit containing the<br>
funds from the Security firm. Though I believe this<br>
transaction should be based on mutuality, my family's<br>
interest will be protected by a family associate, who<br>
is a lawyer(attorney) attached to the South<br>
African Embassy in the country where the security firm<br>
is located. He is now aware of the safety deposit, and<br>
I have informed him that I am locating one of my<br>
husband's business associates (you) to handle the<br>
funds and invest on our behalf, as he might be opposed<br>
to our decision if he found out <br>
that I barely know you.<br>
<br>
For your reliable assistance, we are offering you 20<br>
% of the funds. I thank you in advance as<br>
we anticipate your assistance in enabling us<br>
achieve this goal. On hearing from you, I will forward<br>
your contact to the gentleman lawyer who will be<br>
representing us, and also give you his<br>
contact for both of you to communicate and proceed<br>
with the transaction. <br>
<br>
He will be working with you for a mutual conclusion of<br>
the process and I look forward to a long lasting<br>
business relationship with you. As you may <br>
understand, due to my sensitive position in the<br>
present government, it is not safe to communicate with<br>
me via phone or fax. <br>
<br>
This is why I have communicated with you with my<br>
private email address, and I like us to keep this way,<br>
for the safety of this transaction.<br>
<br>
whether or not you are interested in assisting us <br>
please let us know.This will enable us make <br>
alternative plans, in the event of non-interest<br>
on your part.<br>
<br>
With warm regards,<br>
Mrs. S. Shabangu.<br>
