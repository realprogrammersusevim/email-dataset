Greetings,
I write to seek your services in a private confidential 
matter regarding the late John McDonald who died leaving some funds 
unclaimed in our bank without any beneficiary am aware that you might 
not be related to him but I want you to stand as the beneficiary and I 
will fill you in since I have all the details for the transfer proper. 
This requires a private arrangement. Could you perhaps be able to 
receive these funds under legal claims then I will fill you in. I am 
willing to pay a generous management and transfer fees and your 
participation.30%
     
I will need you in legal capacity to stand as 
his beneficiary. I have all the details and will fill you in if you are 
really willing. Your major role would be to open a bank account where 
the funds will be transferred.All correspondences will be via email, 
for now. The funds in question are quite large (about $10.02M). I will 
expect a straight answer from you. Yes or no. If yes, then let's work 
out the modalities and a brief profile of your person is expected. All 
further correspondence should be at this mailbox.
     
Closing with 
anticipation.
Bernard Vincent.
