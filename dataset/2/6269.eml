Good Day,Sir/Madam,

Please accept my sincere apologizes if my email=20
does not meet your business or personal ethics. I will first introduce=20
myself as Mr.Don Kelly, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a=20
well-known bank, here in London, England.

One of our accounts, with=20
holding balance of =C2=A315,000,000 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) has=
=20
been dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations=20
and confirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name=20
John Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in=20
Birmingham; you can view this CNN website=20

http://edition.cnn.
com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/ for details on the crash.=20

Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this=20
money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the=20
existence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from=20
the National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into=20
the UK.

I have confidently discussed this issue with the bank manager=20
and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal=20
with. We=20
therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of=20
kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you after=20
necessary processes have been followed.

This transaction is totally=20
free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does not=20
originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal act.

On your interest, let me hear from you URGENTLY.=20

Best Regards,

Mr.
Don Kelly.
