I am Ms Winnie Madikizela-Mandela, the former wife ofMr. Nelson Mandela of the Republic of South Africa.
 
I am presently in distress. The bureaucrats in ourAfrican National Congress (ANC) do not like mypolitics at all,
 and they are bent on ruining my life.
I am presently facing legal proceedings for offences I know nothing about. I have been ejected from my
official residence on the ground that they want to usethe place for museum. I am in fact passing through a
terrible time.
 
To save my daughter and myself from total bankruptcy Iwas able toarrange a total sum of US10,000,000.00 while working
as the leader of the women wing of ANC. I have already moved the mentioned sum from South Africa using a
treasure company that is based in Pretoria.
 
Owing to the present problem that I have, I will notbe able to follow up this project as I would haveloved to do.
 I am writing presently to solicit foryour assistance. Could you please assist me by receiving the mentioned sum from the officials of the
security company and then keep it safe for me in your country till the time when I have sorted myself out with the ANC bureaucrats? They want to run me down,
but I need to put up a fight.
I am offering you 30% for assisting me secure this money fast. Contact me immediately with this Email
Address;madamwinniemadela@privateemail.com so that I can forward to you all
necessary details.
 
Kindly send your phone number for easy communication.
 
Best regards.
