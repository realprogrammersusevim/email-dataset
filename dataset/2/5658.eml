DONATION FOR THE LORD

From: Mrs Faith Oputa=20

Reply to this email :( faith.dorman@jubii.dk)


Dearest in the Lord,=20


PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.I am the above named p=
erson from Guinea Bissau. I am married to Dr Oputa Dorman who worked with=
 Guinea Bissau Embassy in South Africa for nine years before he died in t=
he year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died a=
fter a brief illness that lasted for only four days.


Before his death we were both born again Christians and we lived happily.=
 Since his death, I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my mat=
rimonial home which the Bible is really against. When my late husband was=
 alive he secured $15Million (Fifteen Million U.S. Dollars) with a Vault =
Company here in Cote d=92Ivoire. Presently, this money is still with the =
Vault Company. Recently, my Doctor told me that from the entire test cond=
ucted on my health, I am not going to last long, especially, due to my ca=
ncer and stroke. But what disturbs me most now is stroke. Having known my=
 condition, I decided to donate this fund to churches or Christian indivi=
dual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct. I want =
a church or individual that will use this money to fund churches, Orphana=
ges and Widows.


Also, the propagation of the work of God, building and maintaining the ho=
use of God through this money, is very important. The Bible made us to un=
derstand that Blessed is the hand that gives. I took this decision becaus=
e I don=92t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband re=
latives are not Christians. I don=92t want my husbands hard earned money =
to be misused by unbelievers, for their own selfish interest and in an un=
godly manner. I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I k=
now that I am going to be in the bossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says=
 that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace.=20


I don=92t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my h=
ealth, and because of the presence of my husbands relatives around me som=
etimes. I don=92t want them to know about this development, but I know th=
at With God all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I sh=
all give you the contact of the Vault Company in Cote D' Ivory. I will al=
so give you all information regarding the deposit of this money, and issu=
e you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original- benefi=
ciary of this fund. Meanwhile, I will want you and your church to always =
pray for me because God work in mysterious ways. My happiness is that I l=
ived a life of a worthy Christian. Who ever that wants to serve the Lord =
must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all throug=
h your life.


Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church or Chr=
istian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will a=
ct accordingly as I stated herein.=20

Hoping to hear from you soon. Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.


Yours in Christ,

Mrs Faith OPUTA.
