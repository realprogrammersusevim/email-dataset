Dear Friend, 
 
I am Mrs Elizabeth Garang, the wife of the Sudan's vice President John
Garag who was killed in an helicopter
crash on August 1, 2005 .I am currently in Kenya, where I am taken refugee
with my son Philip Garang. 

We ran from Sudan because the incumbent government of Sudan want my son and

i killed because my husband was striving hard For the liberation of
southern Sudan. I want to 
confide in you if you can assist me to receive a trunk box of treasure box
containing $25,000,000,USD 
which my late husband deposited with a diplomatic courier service for
onward delivery to purchase 
arms for the liberation army. 
 
The diplomat is will deliver the trunk boxes in your country in a few days
and i want you to front as my beneficiary 
to claim this trunk box before i arrive to your country, and this deposit
was made under my son's name as the 
next of kin. This consignment was deposited under class U.P.C meaning
undisputed private consignment that is to 
say the diplomatic courier service is ignorant of the true contents of the
consignment because, the contents was 
declared as an African arts. 

Upon request I will scan and send to you the certificate of deposit for
your perusal before the transaction 
commences. Considering the effort you will put in the transaction, we are
willing to concede 25% of the money 
to you as compensation, while remaining 75% will be for i and my son
Philip. 
 
If you are ready you assist me ,please send me your phone number and your
resident address so that i can forward 
it to the diplomat as my son's beneficiary as my i will instruct the
officer in charge to deliver the consignment to you in 
your place on my behalf if only you are not going to betray us at the end.
