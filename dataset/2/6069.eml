My Dear Friend in the Lord,

In a brief, I am Mrs Teressa Stevens, Wife of late Mr Stevens James, a wh=
ite
farmer, murdered by unknown assailants 2003 in Zimbabwe.

My husband was a white farmer in Zimbabwe who was brutally murdered in th=
e land
dispute in Zimbabwe by the agents of the ruling government of President R=
OBERT
MUGABE for his alleged support and sympathy for the opposition MDC PARTY =
led by
the minority white farmers. My husband was among the few white rich farme=
rs
murdered in cold blood by the war veterans backed by the government. Befo=
re the
death of my husband, he deposit the sum of US$20.5M (Twenty Million Five =
hundred
thousand United State Dollars) with one of the Financial Institution, as =
if he
knew the looming danger in ZIMBABWE. We were married for twelve years and=
 God
blessed us with two children.

Presently this money is still with the Financial Institution. Recently, m=
y
Doctor told me that I might not last for the next Eight months due to an
inflammation of my liver. This has led to my being on 24 hours intensive =
care,
in a private clinic here in Cotonou Rep. of Benin. I am tired of living l=
ike
this.

I have decided to donate part of this fund to an individual, group or a c=
harity
organisation that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct =
herein
while half of the money shall be kept for the betterment of my children. =
I want
an individual, or Charity Organisation that will use this fund for orphan=
ages,
widows, and helping land mine victims worldwide.

I took this decision because my husband's relatives are Trouble Makers an=
d I
don't want my husband's efforts to be used for trivialities I do not want=
 a
situation where my husband's sweat will be used in material pursuits. Thi=
s is
why I am taking this decision.

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact name of my l=
awyer,
telephone number and email address who will issue you a letter of authori=
ty
that will prove you the present beneficiary of this fund.

Please ensure to contact me immediately to enable me direct you to my law=
yer.

Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person for =
this
same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated
herein.

Hope to receive your reply.

Remain blessed.

Yours Sister,
Mrs Teressa Stevens.
