Good day to you.

I have a profiling amount of 56 Million United States Dollars secured in an 
offshore private bank. I am seeking your assistance in securing these funds 
into a safe account for future investment purposes but requiring maximum 
confidentiality. This is bourne out of the fact that I am still in active 
service in the Ministry here in Scotland-UK.

Upon your positive response to my proposal, I will provide you with the 
following information:

* How I will introduce you/yourcompany to the holding bank and make you the 
beneficiary of the money.

* Who I am and why I have decided to sought for your assistance.

* What percentage of the money I am willing to give you for your assistance.

Kindly respond with your private phone and fax numbers for easier and faster 
communication.

Micheal Smith
