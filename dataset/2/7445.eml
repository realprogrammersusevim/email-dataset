FROM THE DESK OF MR AHMED SULEIMAN..
ACCOUN/AUDITING DEPT
ADB BANK, OUAGADOUGOU,
BURKINA FASO,WEST AFRICA.

Dear Freind,

I am the Director of Account/Auditing Department of AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK 
(A.D.B) I am writing you with due consideration for mutual benefit. first, I 
must seek for your strictest assurance to this mutual business corporation 
and to retain the confidential of this business opportunity. In my 
department we discovered an abandoned sum of $7.5M US Dollars ( SEVEN 
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND US DOLLARS ), In an account that belongs to 
one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 
November 2001 in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash 
leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery 
that I and other officials in my department now decided to make this 
business proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or 
relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody 
is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the Bank treasury 
as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after five years, the money will be transferred into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkina citizen's cannot 
stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incurred during the business and 60 % would be for ; me and my 
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for 
disbursement according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the 
immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to 
the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank 
name, your bank account number, your private telephone and fax number for 
easy and effective communication and location where in the money will be 
remitted .

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .

You should contact me immediately if you are interested and ready to 
transact with me. Then I will request for some vital information  from you 
first before we could proceed. In your reply do remember to include your 
full name and your direct Telephone/Fax number for easy communications 
between us.
Waiting for your soonest response.

Yours faithfully,

Mr  AHMED SULEIMAN.
Director of Account/Auditing Dept,
AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK(A.D.B)
