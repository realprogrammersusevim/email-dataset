During the course of my auditing I discovered a floating fund in an 
account opened in this bank in1990 and since then till 2006 nobody has 
operated on this account again, after going through some old files in 
the records I discovered that the owner of the account died without a 
[heir]hence the money is floating and if I do not remit this money out 
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner of this account is 
Mr. Adam.B.Husrt , a foreigner, and an industrialist,he died, since 
1993 and no other person knows about this account or any thing 
concerning it,the account has no other beneficiary and my investigation 
proved to me aswell that Adams.B. Husrt until his death he was a  
director of Diamond Safari(PTY)SA.With account number #5005874CB1000.I 
have kept the information secret within myself to enable me look for

However, every legal steps will be put in place to obtain all legal 
approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with 
appropriate clearance from  the relevant ministries and foreign 
exchange departments.We will sign a binding agreement, to bind us
