 From . Mr.Habib Waheed.

Date 20-04-2006.

Kindest Attention:

=20

My name is Mr. Habib Waheed. I am from Dubai . I have been diagnosed with=
=20

Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and rig=
ht=20

now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts.=
 I=20

have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for=20

anyone (not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was nev=
er=20

generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business =
as=20

that was the only thing I cared for.

=20

But now I regret all this as I now know that there is more to life than j=
ust=20

wanting to have or make all the money in the world. I believe when God gi=
ves=20

me a second chance to come to this world I would live my life a different=
=20

way from how I have lived it.

=20

Now that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property a=
nd=20

assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as few close=20

friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have=20

decided to give alms to charity organizations and those in Need, as I wan=
t=20

this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth.

=20

So far, I have Distributed money to some charity organizations when I was=
=20

well. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myse=
lf=20

anymore. I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts an=
d=20

distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in United=
=20

States, Asia, Middle East & Europe, they refused and kept the money to=20

themselves.

=20

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with=
=20

what I have left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is =
the=20

huge cash deposit of  ten Million United States Dollars ($10, 000,=20

000.00) that I have with an Asset Management / Vaulting Company Abroad. I=
=20

will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatch it to charity=20

organizations and use it to help those in Need.

=20

N/B:Kindly note that 40% of this funds must go to victims of Tsunami,=20

Hurricane Katrina , Hurricane Wilma and South Asia Earthquake , 55% to ot=
her=20

Charity Organizations around the World and 5% for your effort and time.

I cannot talk with you on the phone due to my health situation, as I am=20

using my Lap Top Computer to communicate with you. You should respond to=20

this e-mail if you are interested in carrying out this assignment on my=20

behalf.

=20

God be with you.
