Hello,

My name is Dr.Frances Omereme, the Auditing credit and foreign =
bill director of Union Bank of Nigeria[U.B.N]. I am writing in respect of=
 foreign customer of my bank with account number 14-255-2006/stb/t who di=
ed in a plane crash (Ethiopian airline 961) with other passengers abroad.=


Since the death of this customer, I personally have watched with keen=
 interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one ha=
s come to claim his funds of us$15.5m (Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thou=
sand United States Dollars) which has been with my bank for a very long t=
ime before I gave the authority to moved the funds to our corresponding b=
ank called Swiss Trust Bank Plc London branch in order not for Nigeria cu=
rrupt government officials get rude of the funds. On this note I decided =
to seek for whose name shall be used as the next of kin as no one has com=
e up to be the next of kin.

In view of this I got your contact through=
 my country`s foreign trade mission after I was convinced by providence t=
hat your name could be used as the next of kin. The request of the foreig=
ner as a next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the =
customer was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as the next of kin=0D
=
to a foreigner.

I agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as a f=
oreign partner in respect of providing a new bank account or we can use y=
our old account information, while the rest will be for me, thereafter, I=
 will visit your country for disbursement as I am almost due for retireme=
nt. 

Therefore, to use my good office to facilitate the immediate tran=
sfer of this fund from our corresponding bank in London into your account=
 as arranged, you must apply first to the bank in London as a relation to=
 the deceased indicating your private telephone number, and fax number fo=
r easy communication and location where the money will be remitted. Upon =
the receipt of your reply, I will send you by fax or e-mail the applicati=
on and the next step to take.

I will not fail to bring to your notice =
that this business is hitch-free and that you should not entertain any fe=
ar as the whole required arrangement has been made for the transfer. You =
should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.

Than=
k you,Trusting to hear from you.
Please kindly reply me privately on[dr_=
frances@atlas.cz]for my easy accessment .

Your Sincerely,

Dr.France=
s Omereme.
