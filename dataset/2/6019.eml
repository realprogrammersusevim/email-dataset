Hello,

READ CAREFULLY PLEASE

For this letter is strictly personal, intimate and confidential. 

Forgive this unusual manner of contacting you, but this particular letter=

is of exceptional and very private nature. There is absolutely going to b=
e
a great doubt and distrust in your heart in respect of this email, couple=
d
with the fact that, so many miscreants have taken possession of the Inter=
net
to facilitate their nefarious deeds, thereby making it extremely difficul=
t
for genuine and legitimate business class persons to get attention and re=
cognition.
There is no way for me to know whether I will be properly understood, but=

it is my duty to write and reach out to you. 

For I know that you are the only one that can be trusted to handle this p=
roject
effectively without making me regret.

Though this approach appears desperate, difficulties encountered in effor=
ts
to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to ass=
ist
me in securing and investing this fund.

My name is Bona Ken, I am the operational manager in account management s=
ection
in charge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in S=
outh
Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who peri=
shed
with his whole families on 18TH JULY 2003 in KENYAN PLANE CRASH with the
whole passengers aboard.

There is an account opened in this bank in 2000 by this great late INDUST=
RIALIST
who died without a written or oral 'WILL' attached to the account. Since
his death, I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next of=

kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds and=

no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the ac=
count
has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of his co=
mpany.

The total amount involved is 116,000,000.00 USD.[One Hundred and Sixteen
Million United States Dollar]. We wish to start the first transfer with $=
16,000,000.00
[Sixteen Million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointm=
ent
from your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balan=
ce
to your account.

I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the ban=
k
who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of=

the fund to any foreign bank account, which you are going to nominate. On=

this note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the=

foreign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing his/her ba=
nk
account where the fund will be transferred for immediate investment on an=
y
viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.

The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than three=

years without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government tr=
easury
as unclaimed after this long period of dormancy. 

In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if y=
ou
can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a=

reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or he=
r
personal account. At the conclussion of the transfer 60% of the fund will=

be for me, I will give you 25% of the total transfer sum, 10% for charity=

both in Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set asi=
de
to settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.=


Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you detailed information a=
bout
the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this busine=
ss
is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any fear
as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within 7 to 9 bankin=
g
days, after you apply to the bank as the beneficiary of the fund from the=

deceased.

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me e-mail . You should also inc=
lude
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.

Respectfully yours,
Bona Ken.
