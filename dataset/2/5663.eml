From,LAS-VEGAS CHAMBERS,

Attn: Mueller,

I am barrister MBAIWE D.NDUPU, of LAS-VEGAS CHAMBERS. I am the attorney to a 
late contractor to the federal government of Nigeria by name Bunten 
Mueller,who died in a Korean Air Flight 801 August 6th 1997.you can see by

I withhold his name for security reason. This contractor had a fixed deposit 
account amount $38m (thirty eight million Us dollars) with bank (a member of 
the Nigeria stock exchange).

As a matter of fact, I was personally his lawyer that handles every document 
that is covering this deposit. Now that he is dead, and the funds have been 
matured for clearance but without anybody to claim this funds on his behalf 
or as a next of kin to the late contractor.

Hence, I contact you to act as his next of kin so that the finance company 
can transfer the funds to any account you shall provide as the next of kin 
to the late contractor for our mutual benefits.


If you are interested in this transaction, please kindly contact me through 
my most confidential email address,so that I can explain more to you 
concerning this transaction and how and what you will do for the funds to be 
remitted into any account you will provide as the next of kin to my late 
client and also discuss on how we are going to share the funds after it has 
been transferred to the account you will provide.

I thank you in advance for your understanding, and hope to hear fromyou as 
soon as possible.

Thanks for your anticipated assistance and GOD BLESS YOU.

I look forward to your urgent response.

Kind regards,

Barrister MBAIWE D.NDUPU ESQ.
