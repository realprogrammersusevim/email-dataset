Dear sir,

It is my pleasure to write you, pending on this
business proposal. It may be strange to you of whom I
am and how I got your contact. However, I am Mr jordan
Hamson a citizen of republic of Sierra- Leone. Also I
am the accountant general / treasurer of the then
republic of Sierra- Leone I am 33 years old of age and
happily married. I got your contact through a reliable
and a confident source with pleasant motives which I
shall reveal to you as soon as you are interested to
know.
As you must have heard about my country (Sierra-Leone)
and the serious suffering for humanity and the
national unrest killing and hostility in the hands of
the rebels this event have caused much more death and
destruction of properties in the country. As a matter
of fact my people have become emergency refugees in
other Africa countries. Consequently I am badly
affected because the rebels needed my assistance and
co-operation by releasing the national treasury
department to them which I Strictly refused their
entry. Therefore out of my four children two was
kidnapped including my father and they were eventually
killed by the rebels. Further more, all my investments
and other asst were
burst to pieces. Even my life and my wife and rest of
my family are in danger. But it was not only me in the
government facing this hard time, all top the
government official were also maltreated after all
these, I patiently continued but I now see it
necessary to quit Africa with my family since the
trouble never make any step of reconciliation and
Africa continent is very unreliable now as theres
political and ethnic war in every part. Presently, I
am taking refugee with my family in Abidjan Cte
dIvoire under the United Nations refugee
umbrella. Unfortunately Cte dIvoire is Having
political unrest and many equally burst to pieces
soonest, so I am tired and sincerely need your support
and assurance to invest wisely and relocate to your
country through your productive ideas and qualities. I
have  $18.5 million US dollar to be invested in your
country  though your support and this existing amount
is right safe and presently not in  SIERRA LEONE but
lodge in the custody of a security and finance company
some where around west Africa region which I may
disclosed to you as soon as I receive your
complacence.

I would be contented to have your private contact for
security reasons and I am very optimistic to release a
reasonable percentage of this amount to you for your
assistance.
I anticipate your speedy response remain. 
Please kindly contact me immediately you receive this
message through my telephone number or my electronic
box .
Yours sincerely.
Jordan Hamson
