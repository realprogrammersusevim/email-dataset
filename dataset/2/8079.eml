Dear Sir,
I hope this meets you in good well. My name is Sizu Zamba  (Esq). a legal =
practitioner and Attorney to late Mr. Ziya Bazhayev who died in the plane =
crash of Yak-40 jetliner on March 9, 2000.  You may follow the Link below to =
read about the Plane Crash my client lost his life:
http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml & 
http://news.1chinastar.com/ll/english/61934.shtml
My late client was an influential wealthy businessman, a Russian Contractor =
in my Country and a Russian big time Oil dealer and the Principal owner of =
Oil Alliance Company and he left behind a deposit of Twelve Million, Two =
Hundred Thousand United States Dollar ($12,200,000.00USD) in his domiciliary =
bank account in a commercial bank here in South Africa. Which is one of the =
main reasons it has been very important to locate his next of kin. I have =
employed every method to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this =
exercise has proved unsuccessful.
After the death of my client his bankers contacted me, as his Attorney to =
provide his next of kin who should inherit his fortune. The director of =
remittance of his bank adopted a resolution and I was mandated to provide his =
next of kin for the payment of this money or forfeit the money to the bank as =
an abandoned Estate. The bankers had planned to invoke a clause in the =
property Act, to confiscate the funds after the expiration of a period given =
to me.
I am convinced that you may be able to act in locus for my late client as his =
next of kin, I therefore, decided to contact you with these facts before me. =
By virtue of my brief and my closeness to the deceased, I am very much aware =
of my client's financial standing and the bank account he operates here in my =
country.
I have reasoned very professionally and I feel it will be legally proper to =
present you as the next of kin of my deceased client and the sole beneficiary =
of his estate, so that you are be paid the funds left in his bank account, =
hence I contacted you. I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin; =
the bank needs only the facts as presented legally. The rest is between you =
and I and with my guide we can have the money paid into your account, once =
this is done we shall both share the funds. 50% to me and 40% to you, while =
10% should be for Expenses or Taxes as may be required. I shall assemble all =
the necessary Legal Documents that will be used to back up our claim. 
All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through I =
guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will =
protect you from any Breach of law. Please get in touch with me.
Best Regards,
Barrister Sizu Zamba (Esq).
