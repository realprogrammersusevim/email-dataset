ATTENTION : DEAR FRIEND,

The Petroleum Investment Management Services (NAPIMS) in the 
Exploration & Production (E&P) Directorate is the Upstream arm of NNPC that 
oversees the Federation investments in the Joint Venture Companies 
(JVCs),Production Sharing Companies (PSCs) and Services Contract Companies  (SCC).

NAPIMS is, therefore, set up to earn margin arising from investments in 
the JVCs, PSCs and SCs with the multinationals and also protect the 
nation's strategic interests in the JVCs.In addition, NAPIMS engages in 
frontier exploration services in basins where the multinationals hesitate 
to
venture, like the Chad Basin.

Vision: To be a world class oil investment management outfit.

Mission Statement: To optimize the benefits accruing to the Federation 
from its investments in the Upstream Sector of the Petroleum (Oil & 
Gas) Industry.

Major Strategic Roles of NAPIMS:

To maximize Petroleum Profit Tax (PPT) and guarantee a higher Margin 
(Rate of Return) on Investment, through efficient cost monitoring 
reduction mechanisms.To ensure that a reserve base is maintained and reserve 
addition targets are attained. These are:30 billion barrels by year 2002 
and 40 billion barrels by year 2010.
To ensure increased production capacity from the current 2.5 2n barrels 
of oil per day (bopd) to 3 million (bopd)by year 2003 and 4 million 
bopd by year 2010 .
To encourage gas utilization and commercialization
To promote local content input in engineering and construction, 
supplies and materials utilization through in country technological 
capability.
To enhance Nigerianization in the industry and facilitate technology 
transfer.
To promote maximum co operation in communities of oil and gas producing 
areas as well as ensure that environmental protection do as are 
strictly maintained.

As an executive director of the above named agency I am involved in the 
award of major contracts to foreign contractors.
One of the numerous contracts we awarded was to refurbish our moribund 
four national refineries. However, they are still not working to 100% 
capacity utilization. This has resulted in serious crisis in the oil 
industry and necessitated in the price increases of petroleum products.

There has been mounting pressure on the Nigerian government to probe 
the NNPC and its subsidiaries. As a matter of fact the National assembly 
has already started this probe exercise. To avoid the imminent shakeup, 
which has already taken its toll on the former Group Managing Director 
of
Nigeria National Petroleum Resources(Dr. Jackson Gaius-Obaseki), has 
been dismissed from office and has been replaced by Mr. Funsho 
Kupo-lokun, from the aftermath of this forgoing. I am looking for foreign 
investor I could front as partner. This investor will assist us invest the sum of 
US$59.5M (FIFTY NINE MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS).
Please if interested, get back to me with my above private email so that I could discuss further details and modality of the transaction with you.

I thank you.

Sicerely,
Gen. Victor Malu (RTD)
