Attn: 
        {Very Urgent Business Transaction} 
Dear, 

In order to 
transfer out (Thirty Two Million Three Hundred & Fifty Thousand 
Dollars) from our bank here I have the courage to look for a reliable 
and honest person who will be capable for this important transaction, 
believing that you will never let me down either now or in future. I am 
Mr. Frank Lanker the auditor and head of computing department of a bank 
here in London, United Kingdom.

I am the chief personal account to one 
Mr. Rafik Hariri who died on February 14, 2005 You can log on to this 
website: www.hariri.info,Mr. Rafik Hariri who was a Lebanese and the 
manager of Petrochemical service here in London, a chemical engineer by 
profession. And then, nobody knows about this account or anything 
concerning it.

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this 
money can not be approved to any local bank here in London, but can 
only be approved to any foreign account because the money is United 
State Dollars? And the former owner of the account was Mr. Rafik Hariri 
and he was a foreigner too. Finally, at the conclusion of this 
business, you will be given 35% of the total amount, 60% will be for me 
,while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during 
the process of this transaction.

 Yours Sincerely,
 Dr. Kingsley 
William Mark
