DESK OF :DR.Martins Ali
RC NO :  A4568UD


Dear Sir,

I have a proposal for you, this however is not
mandatory nor will I in  any manner compel you to
honour against your will.

I am Dr,Martins Ali and work with African Union
Development Bank Plc  (one of the African leading
banks in the West Coast). Here in this bank existed a
dormant account for the  past 8 years which belong to
a American national who is now late Mr Morris
Thompson who died on Alaska Airlines Flight 261. For
further enquiry view the web-site for more details.

More details about the deceased himself,you can check
on
(http://www.nativefederation.org/history/people/mThompson.html)

When I discovered that there had been no deposits nor
withdrawals from  this account for this long period, I
decided to carry out a system  investigation and
discovered that non of the family member nor relations
of the late  person is aware of this account. This is
the story in a nutshell.

Now I want an account overseas where thses fund  will
be transfer according to the due process of our bank
in order to avoid voilation of any country and
international Monetory law on fund transfer.

Thereafter,I had planned to destroy all related
documents for this account. It is  a careful network
and for the past eleven months I have worked out
everything to ensure a hitch-free operation. The
amount is not so much at the  moment and plus all the
accumulated interest the balance in this account
stands at-(US$15.million US dollars).

Now my questions are:-
1. Can you handle this project?
2. Can I give you this trust?
3. What will be your commission? If you can sponsor
this transfer.

Consider this and get back to me as soon as possible.

Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information
as contained  herein be accorded the necessary
attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it
deserves.

I Expect your urgent response if you can handle this
project.

I look forward to receiving your prompt response.

Respectfully yours,

Dr.Martins Ali.
AFRICAN UNION DEVELOPMENT BANK PLC.
