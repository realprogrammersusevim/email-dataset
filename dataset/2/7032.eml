Dollars=2E 

The contract was handled by a foreign firm but because of the
huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided toover-invoice the
contract sum=2E Now the contract has been completed and the
original contractor has since been paid=2C but the contract balance
of US$12=2E5 million=2C which resulted from the over invoiced
contract sum that has been left in a suspense account with the
CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA=2C is what me and my partners are planning
to take out of the country for ourselves=2E The problem is as
government officials=2C we are not supposed to own fat bank
accounts=2C talk less of having foreign ones=2E To this end=2C we are
soliciting your assistance as a foreign partner who can assist us
and receive this amount into your account=2E We are ready to share
this money with you on the basis of participation=2E We also have
plans to invest part of this money in any viable business in your

looking for a potential and reliable partner=2E Please if you
accept my proposal do not hesitate to send me an e-mail=2C so that
I can provide you with the basic procedures for the release of
