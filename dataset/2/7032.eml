contract sum=2E Now the contract has been completed and the
original contractor has since been paid=2C but the contract balance
of US$12=2E5 million=2C which resulted from the over invoiced
contract sum that has been left in a suspense account with the

soliciting your assistance as a foreign partner who can assist us
