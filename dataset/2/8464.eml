Dear Beloved,

Assalamu Alaikum! Please help my family

I am Mrs. Mariam Abacha, the widow of the late Gen.Sanni Abacha
former Nigeria Military Head of State who died mysteriously as
a result of Cardiac Arrest.Since after my husband's death my
family is under restriction of movement and that not
withstanding, we are being molested, continuesly embarrassed,
policed and our Bank Account both here and abroad are being
frozen by the Nigeria Civilian Government thereby putting us
under hardship and suffering. Furthermore, my eldest son is in
detention by the Nigeria Government for more interrogation
about my husband's assets and some vital documents.Following
the recent discovery of my husband's Bank Account by the
Nigeria Government with Swiss Bank in which the huge sum of
US$700 Million and DM450 Million was logged. I therefore
decided to contact you in confidence that I was able to move
out the sum of US$42 Million Dollars, which was secretly
defaced and is sealed in trunk box for security reasons and
presently deposited with a security company overseas. I
therefore personally, appeal to you Seriously and religiously
for your urgent assistance to move this money into your country
where I believe it will be safe since I cannot leave the
country now due to the restriction of movement imposed on the
members of my family by the Government.

Please kindly send me your direct telephone and fax
numbers,your full name, contact address,date of birth,sex,
occupation and copy of your international passport or driver's
lisence so that i will tell you on how to claim the trunk box
from the security company as soon as you indicate your
interest, I will be willing as utmost APPRECAITION and
GRATITUDE to compensate you with 30% of the funds, and
additonal 5% set aside to reimburse any expenses whatsoever you
may incur in the cause of this assistance while we have 65%
kept for my family safely.

Please reply urgently and treat with absolute confidentiality
and sincerity.NB:Please before you reply me this mail,i would
like you to first go through this website.Switzerland Bank has
also agreed to give back my family some of our money.kindly
view the website:
