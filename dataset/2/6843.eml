Compliments Of The Day,

Permit me to introduce myself to you. My name is Dr Bennie Mcarthy,A Top
Management Official of one of the finance
corporation in johannesbourg south Africa.

I came to know about you in my private search for a reliable
person/company to handle an important assingment on behalf of my 
Colleagues and myself.As a matter of fact, I got your information from Mi=
ss
Natasha Johnson of The International Affairs Department Of The South Afri=
can
Chamber Of Business.


Proposition, A German Mr. Wolfgang Schinister, 66 years of age and a pros=
perous
oil\Gold merchant had in our Bank the sum of
$35.5million in a domiciliary account.

Unfortunately, he was killed in the recent plane crash involving
concord AF4590 in Gonesse, France. Efforts had been made by the 
management of my bank through the German Embassy in johannesburg to conta=
ct
any of the deceased children but to no avail,as we were made to understan=
d
he  had no children.Given the skeletal information available to the bank,=

it has so far been impossible to reach any of the relatives.

The situation left for the Management is to declare the deceased
account dormant and revert the Amount to trading on behalf of the interes=
t
of the Bank. In order to avoid this development, my Colleagues and I now
seek your approval to have you stand as a distant relative to Mr.Wolfgang=

Schinister,so that the money would be released to you. All documents and
proofs to enable you get the money will be carefully packaged once we rec=
eive
your consent on this proposal.I shall Apply for a leave as soon as the fu=
nds
gets into your reliable account to come to your country for possible shar=
ing
and investment opportunity which you will assist me in doing. May I assur=
e
you that this is safe and risk-free, as we have taken care of all necessa=
ry
modalities to ensure a hitch-free movement. I have the authority of my
partners involved in this assignment to propose that should you be willin=
g
to assist us in this,your share would be 25%.

I have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you will not
disappoint me.


Best Regards,
Dr. Bennie Mcarthy.

Republic Of South Africa
