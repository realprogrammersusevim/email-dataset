DEAR FRIEND,

MY NAME IS DR.HAMEED SOGOLO,THE BRANCH  MANAGER OF ZENITH INT'L BANK, ENUGU BRANCH, NIGERIA AND IT IS WITH TRUST AND CONFIDENCE THAT I AM WRITING THIS MAIL TO YOU.  I WOULD LIKE TO DO A VERY BRIEF BUSINESS WITH YOU. THERE IS A DORMANT FIXED DEPOSIT DOMICILIARY ACCOUNT IN MY BANK WITH A CREDIT BALANCE OF(USD$55,000,000.00} FIFTY-FIVE MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS, WHICH HAS BEEN DORMANT FOR ABOUT FIVE YEARS NOW. UPON INVESTIGATION, I DISCOVERED THAT THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT, A FOREIGNER DIED ALSO FIVE YEARS AGO IN AN AUTO CRASH AND THAT HE LEFT NO BENEFICIARIES OR NEXT OF KIN FOR THE ACCOUNT, BECAUSE HE WAS HIDING THE SOURCE OF THE MONEY FROM HIS GOVERNMENT.

WHAT I NEED FROM YOU IS TO USE YOUR  NAME AS THE BENEFICIARY AND NEXT OF KIN TO THE ORIGINAL ACCOUNT OWNER AND THEN USE MY POSITION AS THE MANAGER AND GIVE CLEARANCE FOR ONWARD REMITTANCE OF THIS FUND INTO YOUR
NOMINATED ACCOUNT. I WILL SUPPLY YOU WITH ALL THE NECESSARY INFORMATION ABOUT THE ACCOUNT, WHICH YOU WILL PRESENT TO THE BANK THROUGH A LAWYER.

AFTER THE BANK HAS ACCEPTED YOUR APPLICATION AND THE FUND TRANSFERED,THEN I WILL MOVE AHEAD TO DESTROY EVERY DOCUMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BUSINESS. AND WE WILL GO AHEAD TO SHARE THIS FUND AT A RATIO OF 35 AND 60 PERCENT, 35% FOR YOUR 
SERVICES TO ME AND 60% FOR ME AND TWO OTHER OFFICIALS, THE REMAINING 5% WILL BE SET ASIDE FOR ANY EXPENSES THAT WOULD BE INCURRED DURING THIS TRANSACTION. 

PLEASE YOUR URGENT REPLY IS NEEDED SO AS TO STOP FURTHER CONTACTS.

BEST REGARDS,

 
 
DR.HAMEED SOGOLO
