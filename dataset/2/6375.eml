Dearly Beloved in Christ,

It is by the grace of God that I received Christ,Having known the truth, I
had no choice than to do what 
is lawful and right in the sight of God for eternal life and in the sight
of man for witness of Gods mercy and
glory upon my life.I am Mrs Luisa Raymond the wife of Mr George Raymond, my
husband worked with the 
Chevron/Texaco in Kenya for twenty years before he died in the year 2001.We
were married for 
twenty-seven years without a child. My Husband died after a brief illness
that lasted for only four days. 
Before his death we were both born again Christians. 

Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my
matrimonial home which the Bible is 
against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of US $10.5M.
(Ten million Five Hundred Thousand 
U.S. Dollars) with a Bank in Europe. Presently, this money is still with
the Bank and the management just wrote me 
as the beneficiary to come forward to sign for the release of this money or
rather issue a letter of authorization to 
somebody to receive it on my behalf if I can not come over.

Presently, I'm in a hospital in Kenya where I have been undergoing
treatment for esophageal cancer. 
I have since lost my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I
have only a few weeks to live. 
It is my last wish to see this money distributed to charity organizations
any where in the World. 
Because relatives and friends have plundered so much of my wealth since my
illness, I cannot live with 
the agony of entrusting this huge responsibility to any of them. Please, I
beg you in the name of God to 
help me Stand and collect the Funds from the Bank.

I want a person that is God fearing that will use this money to fund
churches, orphanages and widows 
propagating the word of God and to ensure that the house of God is
maintained. The Bible made us to 
understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision
because I don't have any child that 
will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I
don't want my husband's hard 
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where
this money will be used in an 
ungodly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not
afraid of death hence I know 
where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. 

Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my
peace. I don't need any 
telephone communication in this regard because of my soundless voice and
presence of my husband's 
relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this
development. With God all things are 
possible. 

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of Attorney
who is in Europe as he will be 
the one to assist you in laying claims for this funds.

Please reply to my personal mail: luisaraymond637@netscape.net

Yours in Christ,
Luisa Raymond.
