Dear Trustee,

As you read this, I don't want you feeling sorry for
me, because, I believe we will all die someday.My name
is DR. OJEI ULOAKU, an oil Merchant living in Nigeria,
West Africa. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal
Cancer,which was discovered very late, due to my
laxity in caring for my health. It has defied all
forms of medicine, and right now I have only about a
few months to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone not even myself but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,
I fought against the abolition of apartheid and l was
a member of the leading party in Nigeria always
hostile to people especially my fellow Blacks and l
only focused on my business and the dominance of the
white supremacy as that was the only thing I cared
for. But now I regret all these,as I now know that
there is more to life than just wanting to have or
make all the money in the world. I believe
reincarnation when l have a second chance to come to
this world I would live my life a different way from
how I have lived it.

So far, I have distributed money to some charity
organizations e.g. the National Union of Ivory Coast
Students (NUIVS) in Ivory Coast, Romania and
Afghanistan. Now that my health has deteriorated so
badly, I cannot do this my self anymore. I once asked
members of my family to close one of my accounts and
distribute the money, which I have there to charity
organization and to the less privileged in Bulgaria
and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
they seem not to be contended with what I have left
for them, and have not learn the lesson of all been
equal in the sight of God Almighty.

The last of my money, which l had kept aside during
the dark days of political blood shed in Africa no one
knows of, is a cash deposit of Eighty Four Million
United States Dollars (US$84,000,000.00) that I have
with a bank in Nigeria for safekeeping. I will want
you to help me collect this deposit and disburse it to
charity organizations and to the less privileged,based
on the reason l kept the money, was to do evil, l want
it now to be used for the good of all mankind.Please
send me a mail to indicate if you will assist me in
this disbursement.
God will reward you for your time and patience.
I wait to hear from you, may Almighty God be with you
and your entire family.
Yours in the Lord.  Call me at +234 803 384 8734.

Best regards

Dr. Ojei Uloaku.
