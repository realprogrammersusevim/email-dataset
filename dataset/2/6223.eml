listen very carefully,the situation in my country is very
critical and chaos, uproar and hostilities had brought the
country to its knees and from intelligent report the center
cannot hold anymore for former
president Charles Taylor and his government.

The intense pressure from united states, united nations,
international community and west African peace keeping

and plunder it. If you are capable and know that
you will truly and honestly help me, write me now, time is
no more on my side.
