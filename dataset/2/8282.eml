DEAR SIR/MADAM
Greetings. I know you will be surprised to read from
me,please consider
this letter as a request from a widow in need of
assistance.I am
Mrs.LINDA CAMARA, from the Democratic Republic of
Congo(formerly known as
Zaire).
My husband Dr.TABITA CAMARA was the minister of
Precious Mineral
Marketing Co-Operation of the Democratic Republic of
Congo during the reign
of late president mobutu.As the wife he relied on, he
drew my
attention to the money in case of death or other
unforeseen
circumstance
This his fear was actualized when rebels attack and
burnt our house and
killed him.
Before the death of my husband he reveal to me where
he deposited$9.5 million US dollar,deposited in a west African
Country Ghana.
I and my son Henrry,have since been rescued by the
intervention of the
(U.N) peace keeping force, and have manage to escape
to the Republic of Ghana with my son. And we are now
presently taking
refugee in a refugee camp here in Ghana.
The money was kept in a box and registered as precious
items and thus nobody knows that the content it's
money that it is in the box, all the Document as to
the claim of the Consignments containing the money are
in my position, as the next of kin, I am entitled to
pick up the
consignments.
We are soliciting for your assistance to help us
invest this money in your Country and take us as one
family and you will also help us buy a house over
there in your Country where we can live safely.
We are willing to offer you 25% of the total money for
the assistance.Am expecting to hear from you soon.
