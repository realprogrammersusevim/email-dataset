FROM MR=2E SHAKIR ABDUL  
DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF 
AUDIT AND ACCOUNTS UNIT=2C
FOREIGN REMIITANCE DEPT=2E
OF AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK=28ADB=29
EAST AFRICA=2E


                     STRICTLY PERSONAL AND CONFIDENTIAL=2E   
       


With due respect=2C I am Mr=2E SHAKIR ABDUL=2Cthe director in charge of audit 
and accounts unit=2Cforeign remittance dept=2Eof the AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT 
BANK =28ADB=29=2CTANZANIA IN EAST AFRICA=2E I decided to contact 
you for a beneficial and risk-free business transaction=2E

During our auditing and investigations in this bank=2Cmy department came 

across the sum of =28US$35=2C000=2C000=2E00=29 THIRTY-FIVE-MILLION UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS ONLY=2C belonging to an international business man who 
died along with his family on the 31st October 1999 in a plane crash=2C 
in an Egyptian airline =28 Egypt- Air=29 990 - with other passengers on board=2E 
You can confirm this from the website below which was published by 
CNN=2EWEBSITE=2Ehttp=3A=2F=2Fwww=2Ecnn=2Ecom=2F2002=2FUS=2F03=2F21=2Fntsb=2Eegypt=2Eair=2Findex=2Ehtml
OR www=2Etheatlantic=2Ecom=2Fdoc=2Fprem=2F200111=2Flangewiesche =2E

Before our discovery of this development=2C there was no trace of claim 
from
any person as the fund remains dormant in his account with this bank=2E 
Although
I keep this information secret whitin my jurisdiction to enable us put 
claims
and transfer the said amount through a trustworthy friend overseas whom
we shall indirectly present to the bank as the bonafide next-of-kin to 
the deceased for a profitable and successful transaction - Because 
after five
years the money will be called back to the bank's treasury account 
as unclaimed
bills and the money shared amongst the directors of the bank=2E So it is 
on this note that i decided to seek for a foreign assistance whom his 
name shall be 
used as the next of kin=2Fbeneficiary to this funds rather than allow the bank directors to
share this money amongst them at the end of the year=2E

Meanwhile=2C all the arrangments=2Fdocuments to put claims as the bonafide 
next-of-kin to the deceased=2Cto get the required approval and transfer 
of
this money to a foreign account has been put in place=2EThe directives 
and
the needed informations will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate 
your
interest and willingness to cooperate fully=2EInfact=2C we could have done
this alone but because as civil servants we are not legally allowed to 
operate foreign account in our country and it would eventually raise 
an eyebrow on our side during the time of transfer because we are 
staffs of the bank=2EThese are the actual reasons why it requires a 
second-fellow who will forward claims by our indirect support
as the bonafide next-of-kin=2EAnd also present a foreign bank account
=28Old or New account=29where the money will be transfered into=2E

On conclusion of this transaction=2C you will be entitled to 25% of the 
total sum as gratification=2C 5% of the total sum will be set aside for 
contingency=2Cwhile 70% will be for me and my partners here=2E
Please you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in 
service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this with 
you=2EI will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until 
you confirm the money in your account=2CWe then come down to your country
for subsequent sharing of the fund according to the percentages 
indicated above=2C and for investment purpose like in any country you 
may as well advise us professionally on how to invest the money=2E
All other necessary informations will be sent to you when i receive 
an email response from you or a telephone call=2E

Pls=2E You can mail me anytime via the above email address for 
confidential purpose=2E

Expecting your urgent response=2E   

Yours Sincerely=2C

SHAKIR ABDUL=2E
