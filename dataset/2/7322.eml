a security company for safekeeping=2ENo one will ever come forward to 
claim
it=2E According to Nigerian Law=2C at the expiration of 5 =28five=29 years=2C the
money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody
applies to claim the fund=2E

Consequently=2C my proposal is that I will want you as a Foreigner to 
stand
as the next of kin=2E I am writing you because as a public servant 
=28Manager
with the bank=29=2C I cannot operate a foreign account or have an account 
that
is more than $1m=2E I therefore want to present you as the next of kin 
=28the
rightful owner of the fund=29 so that you can be able to claim it with 
the
help of an accredited attorney=2E

Finally=2C I urge you to provide immediately your full names=2C phone=2Ffax
numbers and your current mailing address so as to enable us commence 
the
