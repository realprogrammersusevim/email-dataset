Thank you for giving me your time. Please be patient and read my email   =
to you.

I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group attached in Private Banking Services. I =
am contacting you=20
concerning a customer and, an investment placed under our banks managemen=
t 3 years ago, I=20
contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed o=
f this communication=20
and I Would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe would =
be of interest to you.

In 2000, the subject matter; ref: bb/tsb/bank/73 came to our bank to enga=
ge in business=20
discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He informed us =
that he had a=20
financial portfolio of 8.35 million United States Dollars, which he wishe=
d to have us turn=20
over on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made numero=
us suggestions in=20
line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the Priva=
te Banking Services=20
Department, especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into ou=
r bank. We met on=20
numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed. I encouraged hi=
m to consider various=20
growth funds with prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to custom=
ers is to start by=20
assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and alternativ=
e investments. Based=20
on my advice, we spun the money around various opportunities and made att=
ractive margins for=20
our first months of operation, the accrued profit and interest stood at t=
his point at over 10=20
million United States Dollars, this margin was not the full potential of =
the fund but he=20
desired low risk guaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked=
 that the money be=20
liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment requiring cash =
payments in Europe.=20
He directed that I liquidate the funds and had it deposited with a firm i=
n Europe. I informed=20
him that our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this do=
ne and in order not=20
to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a 9.5 % deduction =
from the funds to=20
cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the charges =
but later came around=20
when I explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us.=
 Cash movement across=20
borders has become especially strict since the incidents of 9/11.=20

I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in main la=
nd Europe. I=20
undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precise instruct=
ions to the letter=20
and had the funds deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a=
 specialist private=20
firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip =
corporations that=20
handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need immediate ac=
cess to cash. This=20
small and highly private organization is familiar especially to the highl=
y placed and Well-
connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was deposit=
ed. He told me he=20
wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway later t=
hat week. This was=20
the last communication we had, this transpired around 20th  June 2002. In=
 June last year, we=20
got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of that =
particular portfolio.=20
This was an astounding position as far as I was concerned, given the fact=
 that I managed the=20
private banking sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and=
 I could not=20
understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.

 I made futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of loc=
ating him to the=20
internal investigations department of our bank. Four days later, informat=
ion started to=20
trickle in, that he was apparently dead. A person who suited his descript=
ion was declared dead=20
of a heart attack in Cannes, South of France. We were soon enough able to=
 identify the body=20
and cause of death was confirmed. The bank immediately launched an invest=
igation into possible=20
surviving next of kin to alert about the situation and also to come forwa=
rd to claim his=20
estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who patro=
nize our services=20
usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels of detachment from convent=
ional processes. In=20
his bio-data form, he listed no next of kin. In the field of private bank=
ing, opening an=20
account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are rar=
ely held under a name=20
depositors use numbers and codes to make the accounts anonymous. This ban=
k also gives the=20
choice to depositors of having their mail sent to them or held at the ban=
k itself, ensuring=20
that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they nom=
inate next of kin.=20
Private banking clients apart from not nominating next of kin also usuall=
y in most cases leave=20
wills in our care, in this case; he died in testate.

What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practice but I want =
you to understand=20
something. It is only an outsider to the banking world who finds the inte=
rnal politics of the=20
banking world aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fr=
aught with huge=20
rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain portfoli=
os. You should have=20
begun by now to put together the general direction of what I propose. The=
re is US$=20
8,370,000.00 deposited, I alone have the deposit details and they will re=
lease the deposit to=20
no one unless I instruct them to do so. I alone know of the existence of =
this deposit for as=20
far as the finance firm, the transaction with our deceased customer concl=
uded when I sent the=20
funds to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file a=
re just customer=20
services and due process. The finance firm has no single idea of what's t=
he history or nature=20
of the deposit. They are simply awaiting instructions to release the depo=
sit to any party that=20
comes forward. This is the situation. This bank has spent great amounts o=
f money trying to=20
track this man's family; they have investigated for months and have found=
 no family. The=20
investigation has come to an end.

 My proposal ,  you share similar details to the late fellow  I am prepar=
ed to place you in a=20
position to instruct the finance firm to release the deposit to you as th=
e closest surviving=20
relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money w=
ith you in half and=20
no more. That is: I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have =
them release the=20
deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50. I would have gone ahead to a=
sk the funds be=20
released to me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my in=
volvement in claiming=20
the deposit. But on the other hand, you with a similar name as the origin=
al depositor would=20
easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to claim. I assure you tha=
t I could have the=20
deposit released to you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of t=
he final closing of=20
the file relating to the customer. I will then officially communicate wit=
h the finance company=20
and instruct them to release the deposit to you. With these two things: a=
ll is done.

The alternative would be for us to have the firm direct the funds to anot=
her bank with you as=20
accountholder. This way there will be no need for you to think of receivi=
ng the money from the=20
firm. We can fine-tune this based on our interactions. I am aware of the =
consequences of this=20
proposal. I ask that if you find no interest in this project that you sho=
uld discard this=20
mail. I ask that you do not be vindictive or destructive. If my offer is =
of no appeal to you,=20
delete this message and forget I ever contacted you. Do not destroy my ca=
reer because you do=20
not approve of my proposal. You may not know this but people like myself =
who have made tidy=20
sums out of comparable situations run the whole private banking sector. I=
 am not a criminal=20
and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this may be hard fo=
r you to understand,=20
but the dynamics of my industry dictates that I make this move. Such oppo=
rtunities only come=20
ones' way once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by

I hope you understand because for once I found myself in total control an=
d face to face with=20
my destiny. These chances won't pass me by. I ask that you do not destroy=
 my chance, if you=20
will not work with me let me know and let me move on with my life but do =
not destroy me. I am=20
a family man and this is an opportunity to provide them with new opportun=
ities. There is a=20
reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have e=
valuated the risks=20
and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work with me and al=
erting my bank. I am=20
the only one who knows of this situation, good fortune has blessed you wi=
th a name that has=20
planted you into the center of relevance in my life. Let's share the bles=
sing.

If you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a c=
onclusion. I wish to=20
inform you that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny =
knowing you and about=20
this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting me through my offici=
al phone lines nor do=20
I want you contacting me through my official email account. Contact me on=
ly through this email=20
address (qin_wang1@o2.pl)

I do not want any direct link between you and me. My official lines are n=
ot secure lines as=20
they are periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in l=
ine with our Total=20
Quality Management Policy.

Please observe this instruction religiously. Please, again, note I am a f=
amily man; I happily=20
married with two kids. I send you this mail not without a measure of fear=
 as to what the=20
consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured is noth=
ing gained and that=20
success and riches never come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the o=
ne truth I have=20
learned from my private banking clients. Do not betray my confidence. If =
we can be of one=20
accord, we should plan a meeting, soon.

I await your response.

Sincerely,

Qin Wang
