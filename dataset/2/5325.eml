>From the office of Engr; Abubakar Saeed

Garki,Abuja,
Nigeria. 
ATTN: Dear Friend,
Request for assistance: Strictly Confidential 

I am Engr; Abubakar Saeed, the director of works FMW&H 

Nigeria and chairman of contract award and review committee 

set up by the federal government of Nigeria under the present 

civilian dispensation to award new contracts and review 

existing ones.
I came to know of you in my search for a reliable and 

reputable person to handle a very confidential 

transaction,which involves the transfer of a huge sum of 

money to a foreign account.

There were series of contracts executed by a consortium of 

ultinationals in the Works and Housing sector in favour of 

the Federal Ministry of Works and Housing (FMW&H). The 

original value of these contracts were delibrately over 

invoiced to the sum of USD$9.6,000,000.00 (Nine million six 

hundred united state dollars).This amount has now been 

approved and is now ready to be transferred being that the 

companies that actually executed these contracts have been 

fully paid and the projects officially commissioned. 
Consequently, my colleagues and I are willing to transfer the 

total amount to your account for subsequent disbursement, 

since we as civil servants are prohibited by the code of 

conduct bureau (civil service law) from operating and/or 

opening foreign accounts in our names. 
Needless to say, the trust reposed on you at this is 

enormous, in return, we have agreed to offer you 20% of the 

transferred sum, while 10% shall be set aside for incidental 

expenses (internal and external) between both parties in the 

course of the transaction you will be mandated to remit the 

balance to other accounts in due course.

Modalities have been worked out at the highest level of the 

ministry of finance and the Central bank of Nigeria for the 

immediate transfer of the funds within 14 working days 

subject to your satisfaction of the above stated terms. Our 

assurance is that your role is risk free. To accord this 

transaction  the legality it deserves and for mutual security 

of the funds the whole approval procedures will officially 

and legally processed with your name or the name of any 

company you may nominate as the bonafide beneficiary.

Once more I want you to understand that having put in over 

twenty five years in the civil service of my country, I am 

averse to having my image and career dented. 
This matter should therefore be treated with utmost secrecy 

and urgency it deserves. Please you should signify your 

intention to assist by  you sending me a mail through my 

confidential email address so that I can brief you further 

(abu_saeed04@tiscali.co.uk).

I want to assure you that this business proposal is 100% risk 

free as we have done our home work properly. I quite believe 

that you will protect our interest by taking this deal 

strictly confidential, as we are still in government 

service,which we intend to retire from.  
kindly expedite action as we are behind schedule to enable us 

include this transfer in the first batch which would 

constitute the first quarter payments for the 2004 financial 

year.

Thanks and God bless.


Engr; Abubakar Saeed.
