Dear Sir/Madam,
I greet you in the Name of GOD.=20
I am MRS DEBORAH WILLIAMS from South Africa.I am married to Late MR =
DAVID WILLIAMS of blessed memory who was an oil explorer in Kuwait and =
Brunei for fifteen years before he died in the year 2000.
We were married for twelve years without a child. He died after a brief =
illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both =
devoted to our God and respect other who serve him. Since his death, I =
too have been battling with both Cancer and fibroid problems. When my =
late Husband was alive he Deposited the sum of $18.5million (Eighteen =
Million, Five Hundred thousand U.S Dollars) with a Deposit Company in =
Europe.the money is deposited as Family Valuables/Treasure for security =
reasons.=20

Recently, my doctor told me that I have only six months to live due to =
my cancer problem, and this lead to a stroke attack which bother me most =
though because I cannot move as I use to. Having known my condition I =
decided to entrust this fund to either a philanthropic organization or =
devoted individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to =
instructs herein.30% of the US$18.5million goes to you to ensure that =
you are prepared for the task ahead, 60% of this money will be used in =
all sincerity to fund philanthropic organization, orphanages, widows and =
5% will go to the family Attorney who will prepare the Authorisation and =
the balance 5% sent to me to at least prepare for my funeral and off-set =
my medical bills.=20
I am taking this decision because I don't have any child or devoted =
relations whose behavior has left much to be desired while I am ill and =
above all I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an =
UnGodly manner,hence this bold decision.

Since my health is Retrogressing by the minute, you will have to send =
your POSTAL ADDRESS, CONTACT PHONE NUMBER AND FAX and a little details =
about yourself, because I got your address from the internet after a =
thorough search.
As soon as I receive this information from you I will make arrangement =
to prepare the Authorization through the family Attorney for you to get =
Possession of the Deposit. As soon as I receive your reply to my =
confidential email address.
                =20

and the authorization is given to you by me, I will give you the name =
and contact of the Deposit company where the money was Deposited in =
Europe, for claims to the consignment.

Until I hear from you, I pray that this letter bring you and your family =
good tiding while my dreams to help humanity rest squarely on your =
shoulders.
