Dear Sir,

I am  Ahmed Usman,Bank Manager of Union Bank PLC,Lagos
Branch.I got your contact from the world trade center
(WTC) Regional office in lagos,Nigeria.Although the
details of my intention was not made known to
them.Actually,I listed your name amongst four other
names & prayed over them & decided to contact you
directly.I have a very urgent & confidential bussiness
proposition for you & for our overall mutual interest.
On june 6 1997,an American oil consultant/contractor
with the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation Mr
Barry Kelly made a numbered time(fixed) deposit for
twelve calendar months,valued at
USD$25,000,000.00(twenty five million dollars) in my
branch.Upon maturity,i sent a routine notification to
his forwarded address but got no reply.After a month
we sent a reminder,& finally we discovered from his
contract employers NNPC,that Mr.Barry died in an
automobile accident.On further investigation,i found
out that he did not leave a WILL & all attempts to
trace his next of kin were fruitless.I therefore made
further investigation & discovered that Mr.Barry did
not declare any next of kin in all his official
documents,including his bank deposit paperwork.
This sum USD$25,000,000.00 is still floating in the
bank and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year.No one will come
forward to claim it.According to Nigerian Laws,
At the expiration of 6 (six) years,the money will
revert to the ownership of the Nigerian government if
nobody applies to claim the funds.
Consequently,my proposal is that i will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as a next of kin of Mr Barry
Kelly.This is simple
1)I will like you to provide me immediately with your
full names & address so that the attorney will prepare
the necessary documents & affidavits,which will put
you as next of kin.
2)We shall employ the services of two attorneys for
drafting & notarization of the WILL and obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favour for the
transfer.
3)A bank account in any part of the world,which you
will provide to facilitate the transfer of this money
to you as the beneficiary.The money will be paid into
your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for
me and 40% for you.There is no risk at all as the
attorney and my position will do the paperwork for
this transaction as the branch manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction.If you are
interested,please reply immediately via this private
email address.
Upon your response,I shall then provide you with more
details and relevant documents that will help you
understand.PLEASE OBSERVE UTMOST CONFIDENTIALITY,and
be rest assured that this would be most profitable for
both of us because i shall require your assistance to
invest my share in your country.
Awaiting your urgent reply via this email above,please
save me the anxiety of endless waiting. God bless you.

Mr.Ahmed Usman.
Union Bank PLC,
Lagos,Nigeria.
