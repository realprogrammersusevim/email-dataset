Goodday,
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you don=92t know me =
personally, I am DR RANI ALI JUMA, the first son of DR. OMAR ALI JUMA, and he =
was the VICE PRESIDENT of the REPUBLIC OF TANZANIA. Before he died, my father =
died at the age of 63 in the year 2001 after addressing fellow TANZANIANS =
during the visit of PRESIDENT JOSEPH KABILA of DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO =
and YUERI MUSEVENI of UGANDA. I got your contact through the Ghana =
information Exchange (G.I.E) in my search for a reliable and reputable person =
 to handle a very confidential transaction which involves the transfer of =
fund to a foreign account and I decided to write you.
My late father was among the ruling party (CCM) which the opposition party =
was dominated by his Muslim brothers led by PROF. IBRAHIM LIPUMBA. Before his =
death he had taken to Europe  to deposit the sum of US$40 million (FORTY =
MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS) with a security and finance company as if he =
foresaw the looming danger coming. The money was deposited in two sealed =
boxes as valuables goods to avoid much demurrage from the security company. I =
most say that the death of my father has warned me and my whole family not to =
go back to politics. For the fact that PRESIDENT BENJAMIN MKAPA, never showed =
any concern since the death of my father and after I discovered that my life =
was no longer safe I decided to leave to Ghana ,West Africa where I am =
residing now with my own family.
Meanwhile here in Ghana West Africa I don=92t think of going back and for =
this I and my family have decided to transfer my father=92s money into a =
foreign account in a Islamic counrty. As the eldest son of my father, I am =
saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where =
this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government who =
have tactically frozen our family wealth as I may not trust the system of =
African government. Furthermore, the new Ghana government does not allow such =
investment hence I am seeking for asylum. As a business person whom I must =
entrust my future and that of my family into his hands I must let you know =
that this transaction is 100% RISK FREE and the nature of your business does =
not necessarily matter.
Therefore, if you accept to assist me and my family, we are willing to offer =
you 20% of the total sum for your assistance, 75% for me and my family, while =
5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be incurred in the process of =
this transaction. We wish to invest our money on commercial property based on =
your advice and I will also wish to receive your genuine assurance that you =
would not sit on this money when it is finally transferred into your personal =
or company=92s account. If this transaction is acceptable by you.
BEST REGARDS
DR. RANI ALI JUMA.
