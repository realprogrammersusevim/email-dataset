Dear Friend,
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.
My name is Dada Abu,a 74years old merchant,in the
U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer
which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in
caring for my health. It has defiled all forms of
medicine, and right now I have only about a few months
to live, according to medical experts.
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
never really cared for anyone not even myself but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous,
I was always hostile to people and only focus on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for. But
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more
to life than just wanting to have or make all the
money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to
this world I would live my life a different way from
how I have lived it. Now that God has called me, I
have willed and given most of my properties and assets
to my immediate and extended family members and as
well as a few close friends.
I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul and
so, I have decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
money to some charity organizations in the
U.A.E,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any
more. I once asked members of my family to close one
of my accounts and distribute the money which I have
there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore , as
they seem not to be contempted with what I have left
for them.
The last of my money which no one knows about other
than my distant relative who is presently in the
Netherlands is the huge cash deposit of 8 million
dollars that I have with a security company in
Amsterdam.
I will want you to help me collect this deposit with
the assistance of my relative and dispatch it to
charity organizations.If you are interested,please
email my cousin at: paulz111@tiscali.co.uk
Yours Truly
Mr.Dada Abu.
