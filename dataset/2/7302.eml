RIGHT OF REPLY

Greetings.=20

I strongly regret any inconvenience the receipt of this letter may=20
cause you, bearing in mind the nature of its content coming from a=20
person without any referral, but please read and assimilate its content a=
nd objectively consider if we can work together.=20

I am the head of the account department of a Private Bank in the United K=
ingdom and I would like to intimate you with certain facts that I believe=
 would be of interest to you.=20

This involves a client who had an investment placed under our bank's mana=
gement years ago, the circumstances surrounding the investment made by th=
is client who died interstate, with no known nominated successor in title=
 over this investment made with the Private Banking Branch of my bank has=
 made it very difficult to locate anyone who is directly related to the d=
eceased.=20

With the very strong feeling that no one will ever come forward to=20
claim the funds and the investigation coming to a close after several mon=
ths, the need for an assistance becomes crucial, as a next of kin to the =
depositor is earnestly being searched for, I have already developed a foo=
lproof, legal and totally risk free means through which the fund can be r=
eleased to your nominated bank account within a very short time after due=
 documentation and authentication process.=20

The strategy is to use my position and influence as the Head of the branc=
h and Personal Account officer of the deceased to present you as a next o=
f Kin and beneficiary of the deposit. I want to assure you that I have co=
ncluded all local modalities for the successful completion of this within=
 10 banking days of your agreement to proceed with me as the required ass=
istance is perfected to be 100% risk free. Please reply me to enable us p=
roceed.=20

I expect your urgent response and if in the affirmative, I shall advice y=
ou on what we need to do.

Best regards,=20

Frank Jones.
