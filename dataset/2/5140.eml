66 PLANTATION DRIVE,
VICTORIA ISLAND 
LAGOS, NIGERIA. 
Dear Friend,
 
I am a director in the foreign affairs department of the Nigerian National =
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). I got your email during a Personal research on =
the Internet and wish to use this opportunity to notify you of the existence =
of a certain amount we wish to transfer Overseas for the purpose of =
investments and importation of goods from your country. 
In May 2003, a contract of sixty-six million United States dollars =
($66,000,000) was awarded to a foreign company by my ministry. The Contract =
was supply, erection and system optimization of supper polyore200,000-bpsd, =
system optimization of 280,000-monax axial plants and the computerization of =
conveyor belt for Kaduna refinery. With the Consent of only the head of the =
contract evaluation department, I over Invoiced the contract value by thirty =
four million 
United States dollars ($34,000,000:00). 
The contract has since been completed and the foreign company fully paid off. =
But, in the office files and paper work, the company is still owed USD34M =
representing the over invoiced amount. Because this amount is derived from =
the award and execution of a foreign contract, there is no way the money can =
be paid locally. That is why I am contacting you so that we can do the =
project together for our mutual benefit. We have concluded every necessary =
arrangement to transfer this amount to a foreign account as the final phase =
payment for the said contract. 
I solicit your assistance to enable us transfer the said amount into your =
safe bank account and after we shall come over there to share the money with =
you. You can either provide us with an existing account or to set up a new =
bank account immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can serve =
to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till the end =
of this important business trusting in you and believing that you will never =
let me down either now or in future.
 
We sincerely need an honest person to work with and have agreed to share the =
money in the following percentages, 65% will be for us, 30% will be for you =
whose account is used to secure the funds and 5% will be used to settle every =
expenses incurred during the transaction like air tickets etc. There is no =
risk involvement because applications will be made to the concerned Federal =
ministries and parastatals with official approvals given by the Federal =
government before the Central bank of Nigeria will be officially authorized =
to wire the funds to your nominated bank account by telegraphic transfer. =
Those involved over here are directors in the ministry, they know how best to =
effect the transfer and will come over there to collect their own share. 
If you are interested, contact me via email indicating your full =
names,company/business name and address. Your direct telephone and fax =
numbers for effective communication. The name and address of the bank you =
will like us to deposit the money, the telephone and fax numbers of the bank, =
the account name and number etc. Everything has been arranged and I will send =
more information about the business transaction to you as soon as I hear from =
you. For obvious reasons, please keep the proposal top secret. 
Kind regards,
Abraham Patrick
