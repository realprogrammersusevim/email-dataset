Dear Beloved,

I am the above named person . I am married to Dr. Kazeem Anu, who worked =
with Kuwait embassy in Nigeria for nine years before he died in the year =
2003. We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a b=
rief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were bot=
h born again Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get=
 a child outside my matrimonial home, which the Bible is against. When my=
 late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$12Million (Twelve Million=
U.S. Dollars) with a security company.Presently, his money is still under=
 the safe keeping of the security company.Recently, my Doctor told me tha=
t I would not last for the next three months due to my cancer problems. T=
hough what disturbs me most is my stroke. Having known my condition, I de=
cided to donate this fund to an organization or better still a God fearin=
g individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct =
here in.I want a fellow that will use thi
=20
 s fund on, orphanages and widows propagating the word of God and to ensu=
re that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand t=
hat blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't=
 have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are=
 not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be mis=
used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be us=
ed in an ungodly manner. Hence the reasons for taking this bolddecision.I=
 am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am g=
oing to be in the blossom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord=
 will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone=
 communication in this regard because of my health and as well because of=
 the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want th=
em to know about this development. With God all things are possible. As s=
oon as I receive your reply I will forwar
 d your personal information to my lawyer so that he will contact you.




   My Very Best Regards,
   Madam Joy Anu
