Hello Friend,

I am Barrister John Fisher, of BJF CHAMBERS. This mail is written and  
intended to solicit your assistance to be presented as NEXT OF KIN to my  
Late Client. My Deceased Client Willie Jackson Sr., 61 years, of Scotch  
Plains, N.J., and Orlando, Florida USA made a fixed Deposit of Fund valued  
at USD15M (Fifteen Million United States Dollars Only) with a Bank here in
London,and unfortunately lost his life aboard Egypt Air Flight 990, which  
crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31, 1999 (View:  
ttp://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/502503.stm) and left no clear 
beneficiary as Next of Kin except some vital documents related to the  
Deposit still with me.

The Governing Body of the BANK has contacted me on this matter and I am yet  
to provide the Next of Kin to lay claims to the Fund. Under a clear and  
legitimate agreement with you, I shall seek your consent to be presented as  
the next of Kin so that my late Clients Fund will not be
confiscated by the Government.

For the sake of transparency on this matter, you are free to make immediate  
contact with me through my e-mail: [barrister_john_f@sify.com] for further  
information related to this matter. Thank you very much for your  
anticipated acceptance while we expect your prompt response.

Yours faithfully,
John Fisher Esq.
