Dear Friend,=20

My warmest greetings to you. Firstly let me introduce
myself. I am Agnessa Vlachko, personal secretary to
Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man. Mr.
Khodorkovsky is Chairman & C.E.O Yukos Oil (One of
Russian's Largest Oil Company) and Menatep SBP Bank (A
well reputable Financial Institution). He was arrested
in October 2003 when masked and armed members of the
security police force stormed his private jet at an
airport in Siberia. Mr. Khodorkovsky was arrested for
his involvement in politics by financing the leading
and opposing political parties (The Union of Right
Forces, led by Boris Nemstov and Yabloko, a
liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor
Yavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir
Putin.=20
In 2003, Sibneft (Another of Russian's Largest Oil
Company) and Yukos agreed to merge. Mr. Roman
Abramovich who controls Sibneft received US$3bn in
cash and a 26 per cent stake in the merged company in
return for his 92 per cent in Sibneft. Mr. Mikhail
Khodorkovsky my boss received the sum of US$106million
in cash. The stated sum was kept in a Financial
Institution here in Europe by me under instructions
from my boss. I was to make payment to an American oil
merchant on behalf of Mr. Khodorkovsky for his last
oil deal before his arrest.
There has been a bulk freezing of Russian Bank
Accounts linked to the Yukos Company that is why
foreign aid is required. Presently, the Russian court
has frozen the assets of Yukos due to an unpaid tax
claim during 2000 and the company may be forced into
bankruptcy. This is all an attempt by the Russian
government to bring about the total destruction of
Yukos and erode the personal wealth of Mr.
Khodorkovsky. Fear of arrest has forced all the firm's
top executives to remain outside Russia. I have
presently relocated to London. My boss has therefore
instructed me in confidence to look for a reputable
and capable individual who can assist us receive the
US$106million for safekeeping and subsequent
investment. All matters will be handled discreetly for
safety of the funds.=20

As personal secretary to Mr. Khodorkovsky, I have all
the necessary documentations to lay claim to this fund
on your behalf. You will be compensated with 10% of
the total sum for your partnership. You will be
required to stand as the beneficiary of the quoted
sum, while I arrange all relevant documents, which
will enable the European Bank release the sum to you.
Once I am convinced of your preparedness to assist in
concluding this transaction I shall provide you with
more details. Please reach me immediately through the
email address  a_vlachkoc11@excite.com sending to me your
confidential telephone and fax number(s) so that I can
reach you as soon as possible.

Thank you as I look forward to your earliest response.

Yours sincerely,

Agnessa Vlachko.
