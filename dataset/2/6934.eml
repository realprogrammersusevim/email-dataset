Attention,

Do not be offended if by any way this email is offensive to your personal
being; well,my name is John Davids, I work with a reputable organisation =
here
in London-England. I am contacting you based on investing certain amount =
of
monies on properties allocation. For the fact that you do not know me doe=
s not
mean you should discard this email, rather it gives a room why you and I
should be business partners. Please note here that this venture is not in=
 any
form, way or likes with whatever you might have heard, neither received n=
or
been through before. However, my main reasons for contacting you is to se=
ek
and reach a mutual agreement with you, thus needing your assistance in
conveying certain amount of monies to you in your country; most of the mo=
nies
would be utilized judiciously mostly on Properties.

This fund - US$38 Million which came to my notice after going through ser=
ies
of abandoned files of foreign account holder at my organisation; the pecu=
liar
file that got my attention was that of a Russian; Stoitckov Huroni, who I=
 did
some research on and found out he was an Oil tycoon from Tomsk, Russia.
According to my findings, the deceased has been a reputable client to thi=
s
organisation; After much findings on this Multimillionaire business oil
tycoon, I decided to take it upon myself and find out much about this man=
; I
found out he has no living relatives! I also discovered that he actually =
died
in Jail due to his brutal arrest by the Russian President, Vladimir Putin=
; I
decided to take this issue up and I met with some colleagues; we thus dec=
ided
and agreed to transfer the fund into an escrow account pending till we fi=
nd a
trustworthy person or good firm with great business margin whose account =
we
will transfer this fund for mutual. Reasons for this steps is to avoid a
situation where at the end of this quarter, the top executives of this
organisation will confiscate the account and diffuse this money among
themselves because the President of Russia had made it known any foreign
organisation accommodating funds of his political rivals would have herse=
lf to
blame.

We also discovered the Russian President, Mr. Putin has held up and seize=
d all
monies lodged in foreign account by his political rival, and one of such
people was the unfortunate Mr. Huroni. What we intend to do upon your
acceptance is to use you as a Next of Kin of late Mr. Stoitckov Huroni an=
d
transfer this fund into your account and of which you would be greatly aw=
arded
in kind for your participation. Having stated the above, it will interest=
 you
to know that, there is no risk or whatsoever involved in this transaction
hence we have perfected all modalities to make this a success while reque=
sting
for a catalogue of properties for sale in your country, for our study.

Should you be interested therefore, do contact me through my email addres=
s =96
lloyds-tsb@web2mail.com else ignore this message! You would be given more
details upon your acceptance to be a foreign partner!!!

Best Regards,

John Davids
