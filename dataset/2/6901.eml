DR.SANOU BELLO
Dear,

I am the head of Accounts and Audit Department of Bank of Africa,
Ouagadougou . I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may 
be capable of handling this business transaction which i explained below;

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten 
million, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to 
one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 2000  
in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that his 
supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim .

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his busines 
asociate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
Unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner .

We agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me and my 
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for 
disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to your account as 
arranged,you must apply first to the bank as next of kin of the deceased 
customer. Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the 
text of the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

I expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.

Hoping to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully,
DR .SANOU BELLO
Accounts & Audit Department ,
Bank of Africa

Nb.also give me your telephone and fax numbers for easy comunication with 
you.
