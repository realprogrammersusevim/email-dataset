Dear Friend,

I know this letter may beat your imagination, as we have no previous 
correspondence. Iam contacting you to see if I can confide in you. To 
introduce my self, I am Mr Ahmed Ibrahim Tarlor. the son of the late former 
Angolian Diamond Merchant, so now I will like to do this transaction with 
you as some one who have been into production.

My father the late Diamond Merchant made the sum of $15.7 USD in cash. I 
want to invest this money in your country with your assistance. This money 
in question has been in the security company since my fathers death until 
this moment.

I am confused on how to handle this huge amount of money and also what to do 
with it as I don't have any one to confide in, here in Ouagadougou 
Burkina-Faso. May I there fore use this medium to
request from you if you will be disposed enough to help me keep this huge 
amount of money in your country or any other place of your choice.

I intend to invest this money on any profitable business venture. I will 
give you 35% of the total money for assisting me. For the confirmation of 
your willingness to assist me reply with your telephone and fax numbers for 
easy communication.

Best Regards,

MR.TANKO USMAN
