I am Mr. Miku Kuti, a staff of a reputable bank in Johannesburg, Gauteng Province in the Republic of South
Africa. I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. We had a foreign client named Mr. Wooin Shim, who
deposited a huge sum of money (12.5 Million United States Dollars), with our bank.

Eventually, this client died in a plane crash and since his death we have not had anybody come up for the
claims as the next of kin.

You may want to take a look at other passangers who were on the same plane, here is a site for your perusal.

A situation I have monitored closely with my position in the bank. Now having monitored this deposit and
managed it over the years before his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past
years. I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as every other arrangement has been
concluded by me and my partners involved. I am only waiting for a foreigner to enable us move the funds to his or her
account. This does not have any risk attached to it, as we have
our contacts in various departments of the bank that will handle all the internal documentations.I therefore request you to confirm your interest by a
return message through my email and I will furnish you with details and more information.
Best regards
MIKE KUTI
