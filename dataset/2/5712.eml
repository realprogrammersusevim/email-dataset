Dear Sir...

REQUEST ASSISTANCE IN A TRANSFER.

I am a member of a contract award and review commitee.
A contract already executed by a foreign firm in
Africa in 1999 was over invoiced by us to the tune of
$15,600,000.00 (Fifteen Million six hundred thousand
United States Dollars).

In the light of the above, I ask for your assistance
in the transfer of this excess floating funds in a
suspence account into a foriegn account you may wish
to provide, for it was a category a "A" contract,
(strictly reserved for foreign contractors) this
informed my request and also that i am forbidden by my
government to run a foreign account.

After the successfull transfer, 20% of the sum will go
to you for your assistance . 5%of the sum to
compensate for any incidental expenses incured by both
parties.

More details will be given in the course of
correspondence.

Your confidentiality is highly required since i am
still in acctive service.
Thank you for your cooperation.

Regards,

Dr Kanu Chijuka      =20
