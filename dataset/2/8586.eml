ATTN:MD/CEO

I am a Barrister and a member of Nigeria Bar Association 
(NBA). Your contact reached me through the World Business 
Encyclopedia and my insistence on you. Hence, I made up my 
mind to introduce this business to you in confidence for 
the mutual benefit of both of us. 

The sum of US$17.6M (Seventeen Million, Six Hundred 
Thousand Dollars) was lodged into one of the leading 
private Banks here in the Country by the late Head of State 
(GEN.SANI ABACHA) this money was lodged in a DEFACED FORM 
and in vaults / boxes. The money was originally meant to be 
used for his political campaign. Because I was his family 
Attorney as such he confided in me with the relevant 
document papers relating to this Bank died of cardiac 
arrest. As a matter of fact, I have adequately agreed with 
some of the key officers of the private Bank to negotiate 
with you a trustworthy person to provide an account where 
this money could be transferred to your country through 
your Bank account, because we cannot claim the money here 
in Nigeria. 

We have concluded all arrangement with an offshore Security 
Company to move this money through diplomatic means a 
country where it could be directly transferred to your 
nominated account to ensure absolute safety and risk-free 
transfer of the money. After a successful transfer, 30% 
will be for you for your assistance, 5% for general 
expenses, and 65% for us. You are required to send by e-
mail immediately your Telephone and Fax numbers and Bank 
particulars where this money will be lodged and your 
personal contact address. Once you notify me your 
willingness by sending the above requirement. This 
transaction will be concluded within 10 (ten) working days. 
I will be waiting for your urgent reply. 

Best regards, 

Barr. Femi Williams. {Attorney at Law}
