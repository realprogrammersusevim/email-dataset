My name is  Donald Konte .I am 21 years old from the republic of Liberia in west Africa,now seeking refuge in Dakar Senegal under the Unite Nation High Commission For Refugees (UNHCR).My (late) father Dr. Zamani Konte ,was the managing director J & D Oil company in (MONROVIA) Liberia. But he was killed along side with my senior brother during the longing civil war by rebels and all our properties was totally destroyed.

However,after their death and burial I managed to escape with a very important document (DEPOSIT CERTIFICATE)of(US$6.5m) Six Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars,this document indicated me as the Next of Kin .Meanwhile,I am saddled with the problem of securing a trust worthy foriegn personality or an organisation to help me transfer the money over to Your country with the intention of investing it in a business under his/her directives and supervisstions,because I have no knowledge of investment.
