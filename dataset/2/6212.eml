Hello Friend,=20

My name is Mr. PETER k. KHAN the auditor and head of computing departme=
nt of a bank here in london,UnitedKingdom.There is an account opened in=
 this bank in 1995 and since my inception into office in 2000, nobody h=
as operated on this account again, after going through some old files, =
I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently, it will be=
 forfeited for nothing. In order to transfer out fifteen-million pounds=
 sterling) from our bank here have the courage to look for a reliable a=
nd honest person who will be capable for this important transaction, be=
lieving that you will never let me down either now or in future.

HOW THE MONEY CAME ABOUT=20

The owner of this account was Mr. John Hughes who was a foreigner and t=
he manager of Petro chemical service here in London, a chemical enginee=
r by profession and he died since 1997.And then, since 2001, nobody kno=
ws about this account or anything concerning it, the account has no oth=
er beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that his compa=
ny does not know anything about this account and the amount involved is=
 (15,000,000.00) pounds sterling.I want to transfer this money into a s=
afe foreign account abroad but I don't know any foreigner, I am only co=
ntacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved to a=
ny local bank here in london, but can only be approved to any foreign a=
ccount because the money is pounds sterling?s and the former owner of t=
he account is John Hughes and he was a foreigner too. I know that this =
message will come to you as a surprise as we don't know our selves befo=
re neither have we let, but be sure that it is real and a genuine busin=
ess.=20

I believe in God that you will never let me down in this investment. I =
am contacting you because of the need to involve a foreigner with a for=
eign account as the real beneficiary. I need your co-operation to make =
this work fine, because the management is ready to approve this payment=
 to any foreigner who has the correct information to this account, whic=
h I will Give to you when sure of your capability to handle such amount=
 in strict confidence and trust according to my instructions and my adv=
ice for our mutual benefit because I don't want to make any mistake, I =
need your strong assurance and trust.=20

I shall destroy all documents concerning these transactions immediately=
 we receive this money leaving no trace at all.I will use my position a=
nd influence on other staffs to effect the legal approvals and onward=20=

transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from =
foreign payment department. With assurance that this money will be inta=
ct pending my physical arrival in your country for the sharing and poss=
ible investments. I will give you %35 for your help and %65 will be for=
 me. Kindly provide your phone number and your mailling=20
address, for easy communication.
