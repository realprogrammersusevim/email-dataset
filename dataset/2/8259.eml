ATTN:DEAR: 

                    BUSINESS ASSISTANCE 

My name is CHARLES MILLER,the elder son of Mr.JONES MILLER of Zimbabwe. 
This might be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address.
I got your CONTACT FROM THE SOUTH AFRICA EXCHENGE NETWORK ON LINE. 
During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supporters 
of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his 
party members and his followers, he ordered all  farmers to surrender all
farms to his party members and his followers. 
My father is One of the best farmers in our country and because he did not
support Mugabes ideas,Mugabes supports invaded my fathers farm and burnt
everything in the farm,killing my father and made away with a lot of items
in my fathers farm. 
Before his death,my father had deposited with of the Security Company in 
Johannesburg,South Africa the sum of US$25,5 MILLION(TWENTY FIVE MILLION 
FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES 
DOLLARS).After the death of my father, we decided to move to the Republic 
of South Africa where he had deposited the money in the Security Company 
as valuables. 
So I decided to contact overseas firm and companies that will assist me 
to move this money out of South Africa because as asylum seekers we are 
not allowed to operate any Bank Account within South Africa.We have agreed 
to offer you 25% of the total sum for your assistance,5% will be mapped out 
for any expenses that may be incurred in the course of this transaction while 
70% will be for me and my family to invest in your country. 
All I want you to do is to furnish me with your private phone and fax numbers
for easy communication.you can contact me via my 
E-mail account.Note that this transaction is 100% Risk free and absolutel
confidential. 
Thanks and God bless. 
Best Regards 
MR CHARLES MILLER
