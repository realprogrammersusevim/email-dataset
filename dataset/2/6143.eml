<P><BR>FROM:MR. CHEUNG PUI <BR>Hang Seng Bank Ltd <BR>Sai Wan Ho Branch
<BR>171 Shaukiwan Road <BR>Hong Kong. <BR>contact:Let me start by
introducing myself. I am Mr. Cheung&nbsp; Puidirector of operations of the
Hang Seng Bank Ltd,Sai Wan Ho Branch.I have a obscured business suggestion
for you. Before the U.S and Iraqi war our client Major Fadi Basem who was
with the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit
for 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty Four millions Five Hundred
Thousand United&nbsp; State Dollars($24,500,000) only in my branch. Upon
maturity several notice was sent to him,even during the war early last year.
Again another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We
later find out that the Major and his family had been killed during the war
in bomb blast that hit their home. <BR>After further investigation it was
also discovered that Major Fadi Basem did not declare any next of kin in his
official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And he also
confided in me the last time he was at my office&nbsp; that no one except me
knew of his deposit in my bank. So, Twenty Four millions Five Hundred
Thousand United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever
come forward to claim <BR>it. What bothers me most is that according to the
to the laws of my country at the expiration 4 years the funds will revert to
the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the
funds. <BR>Against this backdrop, my suggestion to you is that I will like
you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem so that
you will be able to receive his funds. <BR>WHAT IS TO BE DONE: <BR>I want
you to know that I have had everything planned out so that we shall come out
successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary
document that will back you up as the next of kin to Major Fadi Basem , all
that is required from you at this stage is for you to provide me with your
Full Names and Address so that the attorney can <BR>commence his job. After
you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will also fill in for
claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval and letter of
probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an account that will be
provided by you. There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are
going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the
necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost confidentiality in
all matters concerning this issue. Once the funds have been transferred to
your nominated bank <BR>account we shall share in the ratio of 70% for me,
30% for you. <BR>Should you be interested please send me your full names and
current residential address and I will prefers you&nbsp; reach me on the
email address <A
href="mailto:cheungpuibank@netscape.net">cheungpuibank@netscape.net</A> and
finally after that i shall provide you with more details <BR>of this
operation. Your earliest response to this letter will be highly appreciated.
<BR>Kind Regards <BR>Mr. Cheung Pui.(DOP)
