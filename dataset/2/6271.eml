Dear Sir,
RE: ABACHA'S FAMILY
We were intstructed to contact you by the Abacha's family
(family of
the former Nigerian Military Dictator and Head of State
General Sani
Abacha  who died on the 8th of June last year while in
office) for
assistance in the matter stated below. We have been
consulted and our
services retained by the Late Generals wife who is currently
on house
arrest as a result of  her family's  recent confrontation
with the  present
government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria
Our client's family accounts in Switzerland and some other
countries
was recently frozen in the bead by the Nigerian government
to get hold
of Late General Sani Abachas Money.see attach BBC news
publication for
your
perusal(news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3333557.stm).Recently
the
Generals first son was arrested for a murder charge he did
not commit
and he had been released.see attach BBC news publication for
your
perusal (news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2278292.stm).
However the  late
general has some money hidden some where in an European
country in  the
care of a security and finance company to the turn of
$25,000,000.00
in cash which the Nigeria government does not know  about
(PLEASE KEEP
CONFIDENTIAL)
The funds was moved out of the country via diplomatic means
during the
late generals reign in power and the family would want you
to
immediately travel to this European country where this
security company  is
located or any of the affiliated offices where you will take
 possession
of this money and filter it into a profitable business
venture to avoid
the Nigeria government from impounding this money. For  your
effort in
this you are expected to take 30% of this money.
The Abachas family are currently not allowed  assess to any
of their
account both here and outside the country and so are relying
heavily on
a trusted friend you are and this money in there latest
ordeal. Please
HOPING TO HEAR FROM YOU.PLEASE ALWAYS GET BACK TO ME ON MY PRIVATE
