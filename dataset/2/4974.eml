 A US citizen, Mr=2E Norman Anderson has been a customer of my bank sin=
ce 1988=2E He opens a domiciliary account with us in June 1988=2E The s=
aid bank account, which is at the moment in dormant, is in UK pounds st=

until above date when he was last seen in the bank=2E And since this ti=
me Mr=2E Anderson has not been to the bank nor sent in cheque for clear=
ing=2E This became a source of worry to me and prompted my personal inv=
estigation as to where about and business activity of this customer=2E
Result of my investigation revealed that he was into oil bunkering and =
operated within West and Central Africa sub-regions=2E Further investig=
ation proved that he was one of the victims of November 1999 raid of il=
legal oil bunkering merchants in Malabo Island of Equatorial Guinea=2E

 However, I continued my investigation and further discovered that a UK=
 telephone number mentioned in our bank information form, which he fill=
ed when the said bank account was established, belong to hotel in Londo=
n=2E This is a clear indication that he probably has fed my bank with f=
alse information to protect his illegal oil deals=2E=20

to you=2E After a careful study of the account file and available data =
to me, I have packaged a good deal as follows; and will wish to carry i=
t out with you=2E My Dear Friend, the deal here is that the money in th=
is account will be approved and remitted to any foreigner who shows up =

ur nominated bank account in overseas, but the problem is trust=2E I ha=
ve spent months in trying to get an overseas reliable contact=2E It is =

y in telling lies=2E On this ground I request you=E2=80=99re unreserved=
 but sincere cooperation devoid of greed in carrying out this transacti=
on so that no one amongst both of us shall defraud each other at the en=
