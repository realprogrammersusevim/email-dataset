FROM: MRS. ELIZABETH OGALI
DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES
7 KOFO ABAYOMI STREET, VICTORIA ISLAND
LAGOS - NIGERIA.

IMPERATIVE AND PRIVATE

This letter may come to you as a surprise but it was borne out of my sinc=
ere
desire to share a mutual business relationship with you. First, your stri=
ctest
confidence in this transaction is highly solicited. This is by virtue of
its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.

We are top government official with a statutory corporation and members
of an ad hoc committee set up by the Federal Government of Nigeria to rev=
iew
contract awarded by past administration. In the course of identifying, sc=
rutinizing
and recommending for the payment of all valid contract executed, we disco=
vered
a huge sum of money amounting to USD41.5M (Forty One Million five Hundred=

Thousand US Dollars) on grossly over invoiced contract already awarded an=
d
executed for the Department of Petroleum Resources. Having Cleaned the 'A=
UGEAN
STABLE' we intend to transfer the balance of USD41.5M presently floating
in our apex bank of Nigeria to our own benefit and advantage.

However, we request for your unwavering assistance in this regard because=

as civil servants we are prohibited under the civil service code of condu=
ct
bureau from operating a foreign account or running a foreign company unle=
ss
after retirement in this vain we want you to front for us as partner to
enable us lodge the funds speedily into your account. Bear in mind that
no risk is attached to this project and all logistics are in place and mo=
dalities
worked out for the smooth conclusion within a stipulated time. This is in=

accordance with the fact that you must never betray the trust already rep=
osed
on you. We have decided to compensate you with 30% of the total sum for
your support, 60% for us while 10% for miscellaneous expenses (local and
international).

Please, provide your confidential phone and fax number to enable my boss
(Dr. Robert Swafa) contact you for further discussion on this matter to
his private email address: (r_swafa1@lycos.com)

Please advise in your return e-mail if any time is confidential enough to=

call you.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Mrs Elizabeth Ogali
(Secretary of the Committe)
