Attn: The president/ceo

Dear Sir,

My name is Mr.EVANS PETER, I work in the credit andaccounts
department of Union Bank of Nigeria
Plc,Lagos, Nigeria.

I write you in respect of a foreign customer with
Domicilliary A/C number 6402356789. His name is
Engineer Joseph Schultzman. He was among
those who died in a plane crash here in Nigeria during
the reign of late General Sani Abacha.

Sir,since the demise of this our customer, EngineerJoseph
Schultzman, who was an oil merchant/contractor,I have kept a
close watch of the deposit records andaccounts and since
then no body has come to claim the money in this a/c as next
of kin to the late Engineer. He had only $38.5mllion in his
a/c and the
a/c is coded. It is only an insider that could produce the
code or password of the deposit particulars. As it stands
now, there is nobody in that position to produce the needed
information other than my very self considering my position
in the bank.

Based on the reason that nobody has come forward to claim
the deposit as next of kin, I hereby ask for your co
operation in using your name as the 
next of kin to the deceased to send these funds out to a
foreign offshore bank a/c for mutual sharing between myself
and you. At this point I am the only one with the
information because I have removed the deposit file from the
safe .

By this doing, what is required of you is to send an
application laying claims of the deposit as next of kin to
the late Engineer.

I will need your full name and address, company or
residential, so that i can computerize them to tally with
next of kin column in the certificate of deposit.

Finally i want you to understand that the request for a
foreigner as the next of kin is occassioned by the fact that
the customer was a foreigner and for that reason alone a
local cannot represent as next of kin. When you contact me,
then we shall discuss on how the money will be split between
us.

Trusting to hear from you, I remain

Respectfully yours,
 Mr.EVANS PETER
