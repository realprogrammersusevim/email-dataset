you to the federal government that you are among the people expecting the 
funds to be transferred into their account, on this note; I wish to have a

days ago from the Senate Committee on Contract Payments /Foreign Debts to 
submit the List of payment reports / expenditures and audited
reports of revenues. Among several others, I have decided to remit this sum 
following my idea that we have a deal/agreement and I am going to do this 
legally.
