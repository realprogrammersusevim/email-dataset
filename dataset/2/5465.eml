                        ("REMITTANCE OF $12 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS
                                        CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE")

Compliment Of The Season,

On a very good day. I am (SALIF ZONGO),The Head of file Department in 
African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist search.

When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability and 
reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God or 
Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of Twelve 
million U.S.Dollars ( 12M Us$) . In an account that belongs to one of our 
foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 31st July 
2000) in a plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all 
his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this 
discovery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this 
businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or 
relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody 
is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the bank treasury 
as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of 
this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision 
of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the 
business and 60 % would be f or me and my woman colleague. There after i 
will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages 
indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the 
money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax 
or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice 
that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any 
atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.

You should contact me on my number 00226-7650 9277, immediately as soon as 
you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully,

SALIF ZONGO

POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to 
move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank. As you 
finish reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well 
over this business.
