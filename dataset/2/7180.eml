 Good day,

It is my humble pleasure to write this letter irrespective 
of the fact 
that you do not know me. However, I came to know of you in 
my private 
search for a reliable and trustworthy person that can 
handle a 
confidential transaction of this nature in respect of this, 
I got your 
contact through an uprooted search on the internet. Though 
I know that 
a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and 
worried, but I am assuring you that all will be well at the 
end of the 
day
I am Stevens Bangura, son of late Mr John Bangura of Sierra 
Leone who 
was killed by the Sierra Leone's rebel forces on the 24th 
of 
December,1999 in my country Sierra Leone.
When he was still alive, he deposited one trunk box 
containing the sum 
of USD$30 million dollars in cash (Ten Million dollars). 
with a private 
security and safe deposit company here in Abidjan Cote 
d=B4Ivoire. This 
money was made from the sell of Gold and Diamond by my 
mother and she 
have already decided to use this money for future 
investment of the 
family.
Recently, I rushed down to Abidjan after being able to 
locate where my 
late father kept the depository Agreement made between 
himself and the 
security company. I have confirmed from the security 
company that the 
consignment is in their custody, when I demanded for the 
release of the 
consignment to me in my capacity of being the son of Mr 
Bangura, 
the depositor of the consignment, I was told that in the 
absence of my 
father, the only person that can demand for the release of 
the 
consignment is my late father=B4s foreign partner on whose 
behalf the 
consignment was deposited.
Meanwhile, my father have instructed me that in the case of 
his death, 
that I should look for a trusted foreigner who can assist 
me to move 
out this money from C=F4te d=B4Ivoire immediately for 
investment .

Based on this , I solicit for your assistance to transfer 
this fund 
into your Account, but I will demand for the following 
requirement:

(1) Could you provide for me a safe Bank Account where
this fund will be transferred to in your country after 
retrieving the 
box containing the money from the custody of the security 
company.

(2) Could you be able to introduce me to a profitable 
business venture 
that would not require much technical expertise in your 
country where 
part of this fund will be invested?

I am a Christian and I will please, want you to handle this 
transaction based on the trust I have established on you.
For your assistance in this transaction, I have decided to 
compensate 
you with 10 percent of the total amount at the end of this 
business. 
The security of this business is very important to me and 
as such, I 
would like you to keep this business very confidential.
I shall expect an early response from you.
Thank you and God bless.

Yours sincerely,
Stevens Bangura
