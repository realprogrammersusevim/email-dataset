          Before the untimely death of my client, she had through a secur=

Deposited into ABN AMRO BANK and already the security company where the=20
funds was deposited has sent notice to me requesting that this funds shou=

be claimed by the depositor (My Client) or her next of kin within 14 work=

days, thinking that they are to take the funds just the way some  =20
securities companies did to one of our late presidents wife and her famil=
