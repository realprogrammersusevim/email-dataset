eleven years without children=2E

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only
four days=2E Before his

decided not to re-marry=2E
When my late husband was alive he deposited
the sum of USD5=2C500=2C000=2E00 =28Five Million Five Hundred
Thousand United
States Dollars=29 with a  African Devlopment bank

and believing the doctor I have decided to donate
this fund to avoid total loss to church=2C Less

or better still a Christian individual that
will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct
herein=2E

I want interested church or individual that will
receive and use this money to help churches=2C

The Bible made us to understand
that it is more
blessed to give than to receive=2E I took this decision
because I don't have
any child that will inherit this money and my husband
relatives are fighting
over the properties and I don't want my husband's hard
earned money to be
misused by their greedy attitude=2E I don't want a
situation where this money
will be used in an UNGODLY manner=2C hence the reason
for taking this bold
decision=2E I am not afraid of death since I am a good
christian=2E I know

Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord will fight my case
and I shall hold my
peace=2E I don't need any telephone communication in
this regard because of my
health=2C and because of the presence of my husband's
relatives around me
always=2E I don't want them to know about this
development=2E With God all
things are possible=2E As soon as I receive your reply I
shall give you the
contact information of the bank
and other details that will enable you claim
the funds=2Eplease i want you to be aware that according to my attorney
