My Dear Friend,
 My name is Dr. Ben Mboye, a Uganda national. I was the Permanent Secretary =
of Defense & Accounting Officer in Uganda. One of my reasons for contacting =
you is to share my joy with you that I have been exonerated and cleared by =
Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde from the probe that involves three junk Chopper =
Helicopter purchased from Russia. My second reason is to ask you about the =
possibility of investing in your country that I believe we can embark upon =
together.
 Due to the strong campaign by President Yowery Museveni to subdue the rebel =
forces of Joseph Kony in my country, directive was given in 1997 for the need =
to purchase some fresh arms and ammunitions abroad, which includes 3 MI-24 =
Chopper Helicopter Gunship that have night vision and anti-missile devices =
from Russian. When my superiors in authority concluded the negotiation for =
the purchases, I was told to prepare a ?contract? for the purchases of the =
Helicopters, which I did as the Permanent Secretary of Defence and Accounting =
Officer. It will amaze you to hear that after the Belarusian suppliers =
delivered the three MI-24 Helicopters to Uganda, inspection was carried out =
and it was discovered that the three MI-24 helicopters were junks. Further =
investigation revealed that Lt. Gen. Salim Saleh who is a younger brother to =
the President and his Aide-de-Camp (Mr. Ruyondo) connived with the Russian =
company to supply helicopter that are almost out of service (junks) and they =
were not overhauled for selfish financial
 gains.
 When Hon Justice Julie Sebuntinde probed the case, a report was released =
stating that The Chief of Logistics and Engineering, The Minister of State =
for Defence and myself have been exonerated and cleared from the offence.   =
Nevertheless, I lost my job and was prohibited from participating in public =
services.
 PLEASE NOTE: In my long years of service to my country, I was able to =
acquire valuable fixed assets and substantial amount of money. Why the =
probing of the case was going on, I was advised by my Lawyer to sell off all =
my acquired properties that worth million of American dollars and also to =
withdraw my money from my bank account to save them from being frozen and =
confiscated. Due to the necessity for to lie low, I delegated power to my =
closest aide Mr. Steve Charles to be in charge of my projects.    
 The money realized from the sales of my properties was added to the money =
that was withdrawn from my account and the total amount was US$15,500,000.00 =
(Fifteen Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Since I could =
not lodge this fund into any bank account for fear of being traced, the money =
was packaged and deposited with a Security Company that belong to a German =
national, based in South Africa for safekeeping. The funds are security coded =
and well packaged in a sealed luggage to prevent them from knowing the =
content. Arrangement is going on for the money to be moved from its current =
location to an affiliate security company in Europe by Mr. Steve Charles who =
is currently in europe to transact this business with you since I want my =
identity to be kept out of the money.
 What I want from you at this moment is to indicate your interest and =
willingness to receive this money for investment purposes in your country. =
You are going to work hand-in-hand with Mr. Steve Charles whom is to =
represent my interest in this transaction, He is currently in europe. As soon =
as you receive this email, you are advised to contact him on his email =
address: stvchar1@netscape.net .He will let you know the modalities to claim =
the funds and also give you his phone number when you contact him. You will =
assist me in the investment of this money, but I will not want my identity =
revealed. I will also want to buy properties and stocks in multi-national =
companies and to engage in other safe and non-speculative investments with =
your assistance. At this point, I want to emphasise the high level of =
confidentiality, which this business demands and hope you will not betray the =
trust and confidence that I repose on you. l will render you 25% of this =
money and 5% will go for other expenses. . You ca
 n also reach me true Mr Steve Charles
 As you already know, time is of great essence in this transaction, kindly =
confirm your telephone and fax number  to Mr. Steve Charles. Bear in mind =
that this project can be concluded within five days if you are prompt in your =
response.
 Kind personal regards,
 DR. BEN MBOYE.
