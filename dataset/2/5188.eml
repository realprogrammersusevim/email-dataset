("REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A   DOLLARS 
                            CONFIDENTIAL IS THECASE") 

Compliment Of The Season, 
On a very good day. I am (Ben Coroma  Esq),asenior staff in file departme=
nt in African developent bank (ADB).I gotyour contact from a tourist from=
 your country who was in this country and transacted a business with our =
bank. When i was searching for aforeign partner i assured of your capabil=
ity and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed t=
o God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum =
of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an acc=
ount that belongs to one ofour foreign customer  who died along with his =
entire family in Monday 31st July 2000 in a plane crash. Since we got inf=
ormation about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come =
over and claim hismoney because we can not release it unless somebody app=
lies for it asnext of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our=
 banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed ne=
xt ofkin or relation died along side with him at the plane crash leaving =
nobody behind for the claim. 
It is therefore upon this discovery that Iand one official in my departme=
nt now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the mon=
ey to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and s=
ubsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don.t want th=
is money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill. The Banking law =
and guideline here stipulates that if such money 
remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the=
 Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin=
 in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a forei=
gner, and a Burkinabe cannot standas next of kin to a foreigner. We agree=
 that 30 % of this money will befor you as foreign partner, in respect to=
 the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses =
incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleag=
ue. There after I and my colleague will visit your country for disburseme=
nt according to the percentages indicated. 
Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer ofthis fund to you as arrange=
d, you must apply first to the bank asrelations or next of kin of the dec=
eased indicating your bank name, yourbank account number, your private te=
lephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and location =
where the money will be remitted. 
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or emailthe text of=
 the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transa=
ction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any  atom of fear a=
s all required arrangements have been made forthetransfer. 
You should contact me on this email (00226-7885 7597)immediately as soon =
as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear fromyou immediately. 
Your's faithfully, 
Ben Coroma  (Esq.) 
POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer=
 to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As yo=
u finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss ver=
y well over this business.Please call me and inform me that you received =
