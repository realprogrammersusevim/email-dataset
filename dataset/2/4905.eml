Greetings to you,

=20

This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only =
a day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.My =
name is Mr.Henry Carr, the present branch Manager of a bank here in Niger=
ia West Africa. I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I=
 can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you. LikeI sa=
id, I have a transaction that will benefit both of us, as your assistance=
 is required as a foreigner.

=20

I use to head the Accounts department in my bank head office, but last De=
cember I was asked to take position of a Manager of our branch in Lagos w=
ho passed on,so that was how I became the present Manager and discovered =
a fortune. As I resumed duty, I discovered an account with total sum of $=
10.5 million that has not been operated on for the past 4 years.From my i=
nvestigation,I found out that this account belongs to one Late Mr. Ziya B=
azhayev a Russian big time Oildealer, who unfortunately lost his life in =
the Yak-40jetliner on March 9, 2000. You will read more news about the cr=
ash on visiting these site;=20

http://www.amarillonet.com/stories/031500/usn_LA0703.001.shtml and

http://news.1chinastar.com/ll/english/61934.shtml.

=20

I have kept a close monitoring of the account since then and nobody has c=
ome forward to claim the  money as next of kin to the late Mr. Ziya Bazha=
yev meaning that no one is aware of the account. I can not directly take =
out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am conta=
cting you for an assistance to claim the funds and share it with me. As t=
he Manager of my bank branch, I have the power to influence the release o=
f the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the acco=
unt, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall g=
ive you.I am seeking your co -operation to present you as the next of kin=
 to the account. There is practically no risk involved, the transaction w=
ill be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from=
 any breach of law.If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how=
 you wish us to share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will =
be satisfied. Contact me as soon as you receive this message if you feel =
we can work together,so as to give you more details.

Thanking you in advance and may God bless you.

=20

Please, treat with utmost confidentiality.

I wait your urgent response.


Regards,


Mr.Henry Carr
