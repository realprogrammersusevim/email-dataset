leadership of the son of Mr. Laurent Kabila). I presume you are aware there 
is a financial dispute between my family ( THEMOBUTUS ) and the present 
civilian Government. This is based on what they believe as bad and corrupt 
governance on my late father's part. May his soul rest in perfect peace. As 
you might have heard how a lot of my father's bank account in Switzerland 
and North America have been frozen. Following the above named reasons, I am 
soliciting for your humble and confidential assistance to take custody of

me in the areas of business you desire profitable. 
These funds have secretly been deposited into a confidential Security 
Company, where it can easily be withdrawn or paid to a recommended 
beneficiary. The funds will be released to you by the Security Company, 
based on my recommendations, on that note, you will be presented as my 
partner who will be fronting for me and my family in any subsequent 
ventures. Myself and my mother have decided to give 20% to you if you are 
able to help us claim this consignment. We have also decided to give you any =

money spent on phone calls or traveling expenses in the course of this 
transaction at the end of the transaction.
Please, I need your entire support and co-operation for the success of this 
transaction, your utmost confidentiality and secrecy is highly required, due =

to my family's present predicament. 
I sincerely will appreciate your willingness to assist us as soon as 
possible. I am presently in the refugee camp here in the Netherlands under
