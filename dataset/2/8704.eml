The President/CEO

Dear Sir/Madam,

It is indeed my pleasure to write you this business request which I believe 
will come to you as a surprise since both of us are complete strangers.

I am MR. AHMED, ABACHA the son of the late General SANNI ABACHA former 
president of the Federal Republic of Nigeria.

In brief details, after the death of my father the government of Nigeria 
arrested my elder brother and kept him in jail being the heir apparent of my 
late father until he was made to sign an authorization empowering the 
government to frozen all of my fathers account and seized his landed assets 
alleging that my late father looted the federal treasury during his tenure 
in office thereby leaving the family with visually no source of livelihood 
except for the goodwill we receive from family friends who appreciated the 
good and kindness done by our heroic father while in office as president.

As if this inhuman act of the government was not enough, they frozen the 
account of my mother and restricted her movement even within the country. 
The family being faced with financial difficulties and having exhausted all 
avenues to make the present government return some of the money and landed 
assets confiscated from us, we launched a vigorous manhunt for any 
investment my late father could have maintained overseas directly or 
indirectly. In our relentless effort, last month we stumbled into a vital 
document kept in a little safe hidden in the basement of our house revealing 
that he maintained a private vault box deposit with a private finance and 
security firm in the Republic of South Africa. According to this document he 
has the sum of US$125,450,000.00 (One Hundred Twenty-Five Million Four 
Hundred and Fifty Thousand United States Dollars) in his vault box deposit 
which the security firm is not aware off.

Therefore, in our bid to recover this investment, my mother request that I 
immediately travel to South Africa to hold discussions with the management 
of the security company to discuss possible ways the family can take 
possession of the investment deposit being held with them. It was on this 
premise I was told by the management of the company that the agreement 
entered into with our late father is that his safe box deposit will be 
collected upon his instruction by his friend in the United States. This we 
strongly believe he did for security reasons as the then president. The 
management had therefore insisted that for them to release the vault box 
deposit, my family must appoint someone who can stand in for my late father 
on behalf of the family.

In view of the above, my mother have asked me to stay behind in South Africa 
to source for someone from the United States who is willing to assist our 
family which is in die need at this point in time.

However, please note that this transaction is guaranteed, safe and secured.

Please do not hesitate to contact me at once should you be interested to 
help my family. Also, my family has decided to part with 25% of the total 
sum for your kind cooperation and assistance. My contact me with E-mail,

Best regards,

Ahmed, Abacha
