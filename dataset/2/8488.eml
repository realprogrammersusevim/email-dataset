<P>From The Desk Of&nbsp; ALI SAITA&nbsp; <BR>Senior Staff In File Depart=
ment,<BR>African Development Bank A.D.B<BR>Ouagadougou Burkina-Faso<BR>We=

<P>Private Number......00226 76 52 47 43<BR>PLANE CRASH WEB SITE<BR>http:=
<BR>//www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ( "REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS<BR>&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE")<BR>Compliment Of The Seaso=
n,</P>
<P>On a very go od day. I am (ASITA ALI)a senior<BR>staff in file<BR>depa=
rtment in African developent bank (ADB).I got your<BR>contact from a Yaho=
o Tourist Search.</P>
<P>When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of<BR>your capabi=
lity<BR>and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when<BR>i p=
rayed to<BR>God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an aban=
doned sum<BR>of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollar=
s) . In an<BR>account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who die=
d along with<BR>his entire family in (friday december 26,2003&nbsp; ) in =
a plane crash. Since we<BR>got information about his death, we have been =
expecting his next of kin<BR>to come over and claim his money because we =
cannot release it unless<BR>somebody applies for it as next of kin or rel=
ation to the deceased as<BR>indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfo=
rtunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died al=
ongside with him at the<BR>plane crash leaving nobody behind for the clai=
m. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my depa=
rtment now decided to make this businness
  proposal to you and release the money to<BR>you as the next of kin or r=
elation to the deceased for safety and<BR>subsequent disbursement since n=
obody is coming for it and we don=92t<BR>want this money to go into the b=
ank treasury as unclaimed bill.<BR>The Banking law and guideline here sti=
pulates that if such<BR>money remained unclamed after five years, the mon=
ey will be<BR>transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The re=
quest of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the f=
act that the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as ne=
xt of kin to a foreigner. We<BR>agree that 30 % of this money will be for=
 you as foreign partner, in<BR>respect to the provision of a foreign acco=
unt, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the business and =
60 % would be for<BR>;me and my woman colleague. There after I and my col=
league will visit<BR>your country for disbursement according to the perce=
ntages indicated.</P>
<P>Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as<BR>=
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of=
 the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account<BR>number, you=
r private telephone and fax number for easy and effective<BR>communicatio=
n and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt<BR>of your r=
eply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the<BR>application I=
 will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch fre=
e and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required<BR>a=
rrangements have been made for the transfer.</P>
<P>You should contact me on my number 00226 76 52 47 43<BR>immediately as=
 soon<BR>as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you<BR>immedia=
tely.</P>
<P>Your=92s faithfully,<BR>ALI ASITA </P>
<P>POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to<BR>enable the<BR=
>transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will<BR>prove to th=
e<BR>bank.As you finished reading this letter call me<BR>immediately so t=
hat we<BR>discuss very well over this business.Please call me and<BR>info=
