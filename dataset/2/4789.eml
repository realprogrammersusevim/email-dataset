Dear Friend=2C

Naturally this mail will come to you as a surprise=2C but if I 
may crave your indulgence=2C I'm MR=2E Carl Eblon=2C the first son 
of Dodi Martins Eblon=2C the most popular black farmer in 
Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my 
country=2E I APOLOGISE FOR INVADING YOUR PRIVACY=2C BUT PLEASE=2C I
appeal to you to exercise a little patience and read through 
my letter=2C and I guarantee you will not have wasted your time=2E

I am contacting you=2C as the need to for me to have a foreign 
partner in your country has become necessary due to my plans 
to relocate and establish a private company in that region=2C 
as the present political instability in my country Zimbabwe=2C 
does not encourage financial investment as the environment
is not conducive for investment and most of all security is 
not insured=2Cjust as reported by international media=2E

This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr=2E Robert 
Mugabe introduced a new Land Act Reform wholly affected the 
rich white farmers and some few black farmers=2E This resulted 
to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans and 
some lunatics in the society=2E Infact a lot of people were 
killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was
one of the victims=2E This was after the leadership of 
president Robert Mugabe announced a degree on May 31st 2000 
to seize more than 849 white-owned farms and 104 Black owned 
farms =28the white associates who are against the government 
which includes my father and some of his friends=29=2E So far=2C 
more than 1=2C400 white and black owned farms have been invaded 
and confiscated=2C as well as claiming the properties of the 
farmers=2E During these periods=2C as reported by international 
media=2C more than 8 white and 4 black farmers were killed=2C the
government is not stopping at this=2C as just recently the 
government have asked all white-farmers to give up their 
farms to black farmers or risk going to prison=2E

Before the death of my father=2C he deposited the sum of US6=2E5 
Million =28Six Million=2C Five Hundred United States dollars=29 in 
one of the private security company=2C as he foresaw the 
looming danger in Zimbabwe=2E This money was deposited in a box 
as gemstones and photographic materials to avoid much
demurrage from Security Company=2E This amount was meant for 
the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and 
establishment of new farms in Swaziland=2E

It is against this background that=2C my family and I fled 
Zimbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in 
South Africa where we are seeking political asylum and more 
so have decided to transfer my father's money to a more 
reliable foreign account=2E as the eldest son of my father=2C I 
am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine 
foreign account where this money could be transferred without 
the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking 
everything we have got=2E
As a businessman=2C I am seeking for a partner who I have to 
entrust my future and that of my family in his hands=2C I must 
let you know that this transaction is risk free=2E If you 
accept to assist me and my family=2C all I want you to do for 
me=2C is to make arrangements with the security company to
clear the consignment =28funds=29=2E But before then all modalities 
will have to be put in place=2E

I have two options for you=2E Firstly you can choose to have 
certain percentage of the money for nominating your account 
for this transaction=2E Or you can go into partnership with me 
for the proper profitable investment of the money in your 
country=2E Whichever the option you want=2Cfeel free to notify
me=2E I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of 
expenses incurred in the process of this transaction=2E If you 
do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 15% of 
the money while the remaining 80% will be for my investment 
in your country=2E

I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required in 
this transaction=2E

Thanks=2C GOD BLESS YOU

Best Regards
