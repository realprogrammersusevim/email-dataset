Attn:My dear friend

I am Dr Mike Odey, the Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria, Lagos=20
Branch.  I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for=20
you.

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil Consultant/Contractor with the Nigerian=20
National=20
Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time (Fixed)=20
Deposit=20
for=20
twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00(Twenty- five Million=20
Dollars) in my branch. =20

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address=20
but got=20
no reply.  After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered=20
from=20
his=20
contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation that=20
Mr. Barry=20
Kelly died from an automobile accident. On further investigation, I=20
found out=20
that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his next=20
of kin=20
to date has fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry=20
Kelly did=20
not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,=20
including his=20
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is=20
still=20
sitting in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the=20
principal=20
sum=20
at the end of each year. =20

No one will ever come forward to claim it. According to Nigerian Law,=20
at the=20
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of=20
the=20
Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently,=20
my=20
proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to stand in as the=20
next of=20
kin=20
to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of this old man=92s labor will not=20
get=20
into=20
the hands of some corrupt government  officials. =20

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names,=20
address, telephone and fax numers so that the Attorney will prepare the=20
necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you in place as the=20
next of=20
kin. We shall employ the service of another Attorney for drafting and=20
notarization=20
of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of=20
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will=20
then=20
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of=20
kin. =20
The money will be paid into your nominated account for us to share in=20
the=20
ratio=20
of 60% for me, 35% for you and 5% to cover any accidental expenses on=20
either=20
sides during the course of this transaction.

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will=20
be done=20
by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the=20
successful=20
execution of this transaction. Upon your=20
response, I shall then provide you with more details and relevant=20
documents=20
that will help you understand the transaction better.=20

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this=20
transaction=20
would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your=20
assistance=20
to invest my share in your country. Looking forward to hearing from you=20
soonest.

Best regards,

Dr Mike Odey.
