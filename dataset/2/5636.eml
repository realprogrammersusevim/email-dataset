                 RE: REGARDING LATE MR.PETER ADAMS,

I crave your indulgence for the unsolicited nature of this letter, but

it was borne out of desperation and current development. Please bear

with me.


 I am Barrister Sanni Ado., a solicitor at law. I was the Personal attorney to (Mr.Peter Adams) a national of your

country, who owned an oil servicing company in Nigeria. Herein after shall

be referred to as my client. On the 21st of January, 2002,my client, his

wife and their three Children were involved in a car accident along

Eko express road.All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost their lives.


 I know that my client had no living kin but i went ahead and made several inquiries to your embassy to locate any of my clients extended relatives but this has proved unsuccessful. I only did

so to be double sure of this act. After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to track a trust worthy person abroad over the Internet,hence I contacted you.


I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property

left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by the Security Company where this huge deposits were lodged, particularly the Impex Security Company,where the deceased had an account valued at about USD$16million dollars has issued me a notice that in the event that no next of kin comes up for the claim,the account

will be confiscated in three months time from now if not claimed .


Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3years

now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued

at USD$16million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. 60% shall be for me and 30% for you while 10% is earmarked for expenses

that will be incurred  during the process of Transfer of the fund.


 I have Every necessary Prove and legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate

arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.


 Please get in touch with me by my private e-mail: barristersanniado_2006@yahoo.com, or

call me on my

mobile number:234-80-298-330-21,to enable us discuss further.


I demand you send me your phone/fax number,Your Home Address and a Copy

of your Drivers Licence as a prove of your Honesty in this Transaction

and you are free to call me if you are interested.please feel free to call me .


I look forward to your urgent response.

Best regards,

BARRISTER SANNI ADO (ESQ)
