From=3A Mr Biney I Saac 
Private Email=3Awilsonjohn=5Fbiney2=40she=2Ecom 
Attn=3AThe Managing Director 

Am Mr=2E BINEY ISAAC I=2C I am in charge of Cargo section of ROCHASAB Security 
Banglamung Thailand=2E With due respect and regards I have decided to contact 
you on a business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us of 
the end of the transaction=2E 
During our investigation and auditing in this security company my department 
came across a consignment belonging to a deceased person who died on plane 
crash with this security company without any claim of the consignment in our 
custody either form his family or relation before our discovery to this development=2E 
Although personally=2C I kept this information secret within myself and partner
to enable the whole plans and ides be profitable and successful during the 
time if execution=2C the said amount was US$5=2E6M =28FIVE Million SIX Hundred 
thousand United State Dollars=29=2E

through my good friend who works with chamber of commerce here in Thailand=2E
Mean while all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonfire next of kin to the deceased=2C will be relayed to you as soon as you 
indicate your interest and willingness to assist us and also benefit yourself

to this great deal=2E In fact I could have done this deal alone but 
because of my position in this country as a civil servant=2C we are not 
allowed to operate a foreign account and would eventually raise an eyebrow on 
my side during the time of transfer because I work in this company=2E 
This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who 
will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to 
the security company and also present a foreign account where he will need 
the money to be re-transferred into on his request as it may be after due 
verification and clarification by designation back account=2E 
I will not fail to inform you that this transaction is 100% risk free=2E On 
smooth conclusion of this transaction=2C you will be entitled to 30% of the 
total sum as gratification=2C while 10% we be set aside to take care of 
expenses that may arise during the fine of transfer and also telephone 
bills=2C while 60% will be for me and by partners=2E 

Please=2C you have been advised to keep top secret as we are still in service 
and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you=2E 
I will write application to rinsing out have the company and join business=2E 
And it will require us to come down to your country for subsequent sharing 
of this found according to percentages previously indicated and further 
investment either in your country or any country you advice us to invest in=2E
