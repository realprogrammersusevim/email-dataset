Department with the

for me to handle the

foreign partner abroad
like you. 20% of this sum would be for you as compensation for using your 
Bank account in
transferring this money, 5% would be used to re-imburse the expenses made by 
both parties during
the processing of the transfer which includes, telephone bills, aveling 
expenses and fees. While
75% is for me. Please note that I will arrange to meet with you immediately 
after the successful conclusion of the transfer, the 75% share of mine will 
be used for investment overseas. Your assistance and co-operation is highly 
needed. I assure you that this transaction is 100% risk free. If you are
