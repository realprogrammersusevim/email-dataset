FROM THE DESK OF MR.AZIZE  OUATTARA
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO


I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance departmen=
t
of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK BURKINA FASO. I got your contact address
through internet net work search when searching for a good and reliable
person that will assist me in this transaction.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 22.85m US Dollars (twe=
nty two milllion eight hundred and Fifty thousand us dollars)in an
account thatbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died on 25th JULY
2000 IN SUPER SONIC CONCORDE plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN =
PARIS FRANCE along with his entire family.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next=

of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it
unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased=

as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that
all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the p=
lane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this=
 discovery that I decided to make this business proposal to you and relea=
se the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for sa=
fety and subsequent
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money to=
 
go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained=

unclamed after seven year, the money will be transfered into the Bank
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by=

the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand a=
s
next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account and 70% would be for ME;

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of=

the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and=

location where in  the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text o=
f
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail   thro=
ugh
my  private line +22676524743 or  email adress  azize_ouattara25@yahoo.co=
