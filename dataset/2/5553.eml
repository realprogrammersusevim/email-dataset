Dear Friend,
    
I discovered a dormant account in my office,as the 
auditor of my bank.
It will be in my interest to transfer this fund 
worth Twenty Million 
dollars Sterling {U. S.$20,000,000.00).
in an 
account offshore.

If you can be a collaborator/partner to this please 
indicate interest 
immediately for us to proceed. Remember this is 
absolutely confidential,
as I am seeking your assistance as the 
beneficiary of this unclaimed funds.
  
since we are not allowed to 
operate a foreign account,Your contact phone

necessary for this effect, I have reposed my 
confidence in you and 
hope that you will not disappoint me.
