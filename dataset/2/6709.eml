   Dear Friend,
  My name is Ola George,General Manager, Corporate and Investment Banking 
Division(South)with African Continental Bank Plc,Lagos-Nigeria.I came 
to know about you in my private search for a reliable person/company to 
handle a confidential transaction on behalf of myself.As a matter of 
fact, I got your information from the Nigerian Chamber of Commerce and 
Industry/Nigerian Export Promotion Council.
  l write in respect of a foreign customer with our Bank,who 
unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Union Transport 
Africaines Flight 
Boeing 727  which crashed on December 25,2003.
  Since the death of this our customer , I have kept a close monitoring 
of the deposit records and accounts since then. Nobody has come forward 
to claim the money in his A/C as next of kin to the late customer. The 
total amount in the account is US$12.5 million and it is a domiciliary 
escrow bank account. Also the funds can only be released to a 
foreigner. 
  As it stands now, there is nobody in the position to produce the needed 
information other than my very self-considering my position in the 
bank.Based on the fact that all the family perished in the same flight 
accident, leaving no one to put claim of the deposit as the next of 
kin,so 
I am seeking for your co-operation to present you as the next of kin, 
and arrange for the release of the funds to your honour for our mutual 
benefit.
  I am willing to share this money with you in the ratio of 70-30%.You 
shall have 30% of the funds and I shall have the rest (70%) .I hope 
this 
is a fair sharing?
I look forward to hear  from you urgently so that we can proceed 
accordingly.I wait for your urgent response.
  Best Regards. 
Mr.OLA GEORGE
