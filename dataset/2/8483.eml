Dearest One,


              CONFIDENTIAL


I am JOEL JOHNSON the only son of late former Director of finance, Chief =
VINCENT E. JOHNSON Sierra-Leone diamond and mining corporation. I must co=
nfess my agitation is real, and my words is my bond,in this proposal. My =
late father diverted this money meant for purchase of ammunition, for my =
country,during the peak of disastrous civil war in my country,now he has =
deposited the money with a BANK in Abidjan,

where I am residing under political Assylum with my younger sister MARY J=
OHNSON who is 17 years old.


Now the war in my country is over with the help of ECOMOG soldiers, the p=
resent government of Sierra Leone has revoked the passport of all officer=
s who served under the former regime and now ask countries

to expel such person at the same time freeze their account and confiscate=
 their asset, it is on this note that I am contacting you, all I needed f=
rom you is to furnish me with your bank particulars:


1) Account name

2) Account number

3) Bank address, telephone and fax number

4) your private telephone /fax numbers


For you to assist me transfer this money in your private bank account, th=
e said amount is Seventheen Million Dollars (US$17.000.000.00 Million). I=
 am compensating you with 15 % of the total money amount,

now all my hope is banked on you and I really wants to invest this money =
in your country, were their is stability of Government, political and eco=
nomic welfare.


Honestly I want you to believe that this transaction is real and never a =
joke. My late father Chief VINCENT JOHNSON gave me the deposit slip issue=
d to him by the BANK on the date of deposit, for you to be clarify becaus=
e, I do not expose my self to anybody I see, I believe that you are able =
to keep this transaction secret for me because this money is the hope of =
my life, it is important.


Please write me immediately after you must have gone through my message f=
ill free and make it urgent. That is the reason why I offered you 15 % of=
 the total money amount, and in case of any other necessary

expenses you might incure, I am resolving to give you an addition of 2% d=
uring this transaction.


N.B Try and negotiate for me some profitable blue chip investment opportu=
nities which is risky free which I can invest with this money when it is =
transferred to your account, personally I am interested in estate managem=
ent and hotel business, please advise me. And promise me and my younger s=
ister to be our guardian considering our situation and not to betray us.


And my late father used me the only son as the beneficiary / next of kin =
on the day of deposit and also told me I need an assistance of a foreigne=
r with a legitimate bank Account abroad who will stand as

co-beneficiary and partner abroad to ensure a successful hitch free trans=
fer of the fund abroad.


Thanks and God bless


Yours Children.


JOEL/MARY JOHNSON
