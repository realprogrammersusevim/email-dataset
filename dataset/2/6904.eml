Attn: Dear Friend,

I wish my proposal would not come to you as a surprise. I am LEE TSONG,
I 
work as you would have seen with CITICORP, although this being a brief 
introduction.

Anyway, we had a foreign client (Mohamed Mohd Salaheldin) who deposited

a 
huge sum of amount, US$28.5million (Twenty Eight Million Five Hundred 
Thousand United States Dollars) with our bank.

Unfortunately, this client was among the victims of EGYPTAIR FLIGHT 
NO.990 
that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in U.S.A. Confirmable from the below 
website 
www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html

http://www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html or

www.greatdreams.com/plane990.htm but, since then we have not had 
anybody to 
come for the claims as the next of kin. A situation I have monitored 
closely 
with my position in the bank.

Now, having monitored this deposit and managed it over the years before

his 
death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next of kin for the past 
two 
years plus, I have removed the file to my "private vault".

I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as 
every 
other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting for a

foreigner to enable me move the funds to his account. This does not 
have any 
risk attached to it as all the internal documentations would be handled

by 
me and every loop holes sealed off.

I therefore request you to confirm your interest by a return message 
and I 
will furnish you with the full details and what to do concerning this 
deal. 
What you stand to gain would be discussed and it is negotiable before 
the 
deal commences.

NOTE: PLEASE KINDLY SEND YOUR TO THE ADDRESS BELOW

lee_tsong@irangate.net

Believing to hear from you soonest.

Kind regards,

LEE TSONG .
