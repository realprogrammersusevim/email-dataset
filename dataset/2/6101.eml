TENDER COMMITTEE

Dear Friend,
 It is my great pleasure in writing you this letter on behalf of my colleag=
ues. Your information was given to me by a member of the South African Expo=
rt Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Federal Government delegation=
 on a trip to your country for a bilateral conference talk to encourage for=
eign investors. I have decided to seek a
confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the deal described
here under for the benefit of all parties and hope you will keep it confide=
ntial because of the nature of this business
Within the Department of Minerals an Energy where I work as a Director of A=
udit and Project Implementation and with the co-operation of two other top =
officials, we have in our possession as overdue
payment in US funds.
 The said funds represent certain percentage of the total contract value ex=
ecuted on behalf of my Department by a foreign
contracting firm which we the officials over-invoiced to the amount of US$1=
4.500,000.00Dollars.Though the actual contract cost has been paid to the or=
iginal contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.
 Since the present elected Government is determined to pay foreign contract=
ors all debts owed so as to maintain good relationship with foreign governm=
ent and non-government agencies, we include our bills for approvals with th=
e Department of Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa. We are seekin=
g your assistance to front as beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, since we =
are not allowed to operate foreign accounts. Details and change of benefici=
ary information upon application for claim to reflect payment and approvals=
 will be secured on behalf of You/your Company.
  I have the authority of my partners involved to propose that should you b=
e willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will =
be US$3.625m (25%), while my colleagues and I receive US$9.425m  (65%) and =
the balance of US$1.450m (10%) for taxation and miscellaneous expenses incu=
rred.
 The business itself is 100% safe and secure, provided you treat it with ut=
most confidentiality. It does not matter whether You/your Company does cont=
ract projects, as a transfer of powers will be secured in favor of You/your=
 Company. Also your area of specialization is not a hindrance to the succes=
sful execution of this transaction. I have reposed
my confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint me.
 Kindly notify me for further details upon your acceptance of this proposal
