that Mr=2E Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein 
=28former Iraqi President=29 during one of his trips to his country Iraq=2C as he was 
accused of leaking information to the Americans=2E On further investigation=2C I 
discovered that Mr=2E Al Nasser=92s family wife and two sons died during the Gulf War 
in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare any next of kin or relation in 
all his official documents=2C including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did 
not leave any WILL=2E  This sum of US$17=2C500=2C000=2E00 have been floating and placed under

owner since 2003=2E  I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have made so 
far=2C my bank management is not aware of it=2C I am the only one that have the 
information=2E

With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to support 
the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U=2E A=2E E=2E  By end of this year=2C 
the government will pass a new financial control law which will give the government 
authority to interrogate account owners of above $5=2C000=2C000=2E00 to explain the source 
of the funds=2Cmaking sure it is not for terrorism support=2E  If I do not move this money 
out of the country immediately=2C by end of the year the government will definitely 
confiscate the money=2C because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain 
the source of the money=2E  

I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and that is why 
I am contacting you for an assistance=2E  As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser=2C coupled
with my present position and status in the bank as Head of Retail Banking Groug =2C I have 
the power to influence the release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next 
of kin to the account=2C with the correct information concerning the account=2C which I shall 
give you=2E  All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and
