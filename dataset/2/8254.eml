Dear Sir,

Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad 
necessitate
this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of
USD21,000.000 (twenty one million  dollars)inherited from my father's 
business
reserve.

I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He 
became
rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by
President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown
gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white 
farmers.
Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and
property then decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and
security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property 
of
our family since our home was burnt,and the farmlands and machines seized; 
yet
the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.

To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 15% =

of
the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 25%
share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture.
There are however some minimal cost involved in securing the release of this
deposit from the present holding company.i do not intend to overburden you 
with
these cost.but you must know beforehand that we will be sharing whatever 
cost
involved in retrieving this deposit and putting it to beneficial use.



if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed
information. if you do not accept my offer,please in good fate treat with 
utmost
confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers to
for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,
frankzambani
