Greetings from UAE

HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL=2E

I decided to contact you by email because I feel that it is more secured and private=2E I am Nasser Bin Nasiri=2C Director of Procurement and Contract Award with=2C Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources =5BMPMR=5D=2E I am contacting you concerning the transfer of US$43 Million Dollars =28FOURTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS=29 

Sometime ago=2C a contract was awarded by my Corporation=2C =5BMPMR=5D to a Japanese Firm=2C to carry out Turn Around Maintenance and rehabilitation work on Emirates Petroleum Products Company =28EPPCO=29 This contract was over invoiced by us to the tune of US$43=2E Million {Forty Three Million United States Dollars=29=2E  Myself and my partner reached a compromise to transfer the
fund into a Foreign bank account that will accommodate
this fund=2E We have all modalities set=2E

We were disappointed last time by a US Senator=2C Late Paul Wellstone whom we trusted with a transaction of this nature up to the tune of $45 Million USD in 2001=2E They sat on our money for no apparent reason and was still holding our money until his family were killed in a plane crash last December=2E   We still believe
that good people still exist in this world and we are willing to try again with you=2C bearing in mind that God will all way fight for us=2E  

You can confirm the above transaction from Mr=2E Clarence Barnes=2C Uncle to the Senator=2C who provided the receiving bank account=2E  His email address is cbarnes=40worldemail=2Ecom and phone 1-661-310-2112=2E   He is enjoying our collective money and refused to give us our share but we believe=2C he shall meet his doom as Senator did=2E  Because of this we are afraid and we need your total trust and assurance that you must be an honest and straight forward person=2E  We made a costly mistake with the Senator=2C by not going into agreement=2E

Based on our status as senior government officials in top sensitive position of trust=2C we cannot stand to claim this money ourselves without the assistance of a foreigner=2E  The process will not require your presence here in UAE=2E  I guarantee that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law=2E 

We intend to share the money in the following manner=3A 30% for you=2C 60% for us and 10% will be for any expenses incured during the transfer=2E  Contact me immediately if you are interested for further details=2E  We look forward to a fruitful business relationship with you and your urgent response=2E 

Best Regards=2C 

Mr=2E Nasser Bin Nasiri=2E
