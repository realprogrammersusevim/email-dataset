DEAR FRIEND,

WE ARE MEMBERS OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE FOR BUDGET AND PLANNING
OF THE MINISTRY OF PETROLEUM,

THIS COMMITTE IS PRINCIPALLY CONCERNED WITH CONTRACT
APPRAISALS AND APPROVAL OF CONTRACTS IN ORDER OF PRIORITIES
AS REGARDS CAPITAL PROJECTS OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OF
NIGERIA. WE ARE SENDING YOU THIS MAIL BASED ON THE
INFORMATION WE GATHERED FROM THE TRADE OFFICE OF THE
NIGERIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ANDINDUSTRY. WE BELIEVE THAT
YOU WOULD BE IN GOOD POSITION TO HELP US IN OUR BID TO
TRANSFER THE SUM OF TWENTY FOUR MILLION, EIGHT HUNDRED
THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS (US$24.8)INTO FOREIGN
ACCOUNT. WHICH WE SUCCESSFULLY SECURED WITH OUR POSITION
IN THE GOVERNMENT.

THIS AMOUNT WAS ACCUMULATED THROUGH UNDECLARED WINDFALL
FROM OIL SALES OF CRUDE OIL DURING THE GULF WAR.WHAT WE
NEED FROM YOU IS TO PROVIDE A SAFE ACCOUNT INTO WHICH THE
FUNDS WILL BE TRANSFERRED SINCE GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE
NOT ALLOWED BY OUR LAWS TO OPERATE FOREIGNACCOUNT. IT
HAS BEEN THAT THE OWNER OF THE ACCOUNT WILL BE COMPENSATED
WITH US$4.160MILLION OF THE TOTAL REMITTED FUNDS, WE KEEP
US$19 MILLION FOR OUR PERSONAL USE, WHILE US$1,640 MILLION,
WILL BE OFFSET FOR ANY EXPENSES AND PAY THE NECESSARY
TAXES. THE FUND, IS PRESENTLY IN A SUSPENCE ACCOUNT IN THE
CENTRAL BANK OF NIGERIA WAITING FOR CLAIM. SO ONCE WE
RECEIVE YOUR EARLIEST RESPOND WE SHALL PUT IN APPLICATION
ON
YOUR BEHALF NOTIFYING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IT IS YOUR
CONTRACT PAYMENT AND AS WELL LEGALISE SOME VITAL DOCUMENTS
ON YOUR FAVOUR WITH OUR GOOD POSITION IN GOVERNMENT. AND
THE DOCUMENTS WILL BE SENT TO CENRAL BANK AS PROVE OF
OWNERSHIP OF THE SAID FUND. IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW
THAT TWO YEARS AGO A SIMILAR TRANSACTION WAS CARRIED OUT
WITH ONE MR. PATRICE MILLER THE PRESIDENT OF CRAINE
INTERNATIONAL TRADING CORPORATION AT #135, EAST 57TH
STREET, 28TH FLOOR, NEW YORK. 10022 WITH TELEPHONE (212)
308-7788 AND TELEX # 6731689, AFTER THE AGREEMENT BETWEEN
BOTH PARTNERS IN WHICH HE WAS TOTAKE 5%.THE MONEY
WAS DULY TRANSFERRED INTO HIS ACCOUNT ONLY TO BE
DISSAPOINTED ON OUR ARRIVAL IN NEW YORK AS WE WERE RELIABLY
INFORMED THAT MR. PATRIC MILLER WAS NO LONGER ON THAT
ADDRESS WHILE HIS TELEPHOE AND TELEX NUMBERS HAVE BEEN
REALLOCATED TO SOMEONE ELSE, THAT IS HOW WE LOST
US$27.5MILLION TO MR. PATRICE MILLER.THIS TIME AROUND WE
NEED A MORE RELIABLE AND TRUSTWORTHY PERSON OR A REPUTABLE
COMPANY THAT WE CAN AS WELL CONTINUE IN BUSINESS AFTER THIS
PRESENT TRANSACTION, SO IF YOU CAN PROVE YOURSELF TO BE
TRUSTED AND INTERESTED IN THIS DEAL THEN WE ARE PREPARED TO
DO BUSINESS WITH YOU.

AND ALL WE WANT FROM YOU IS THE ASSURANCE THAT YOU WILL LET
US HAVE OUR SHARE WHEN THIS AMOUNT OF US$24.8MILLION IS
TRANFERRED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. PLEASE EMAIL YOUR RESPONSE SO
THAT WE CAN ADVISE YOU ON THE MODALITIES OF THE
TRANSACTION. ALL MODALITIES HAVE BEEN WORKED OUTAND
