FROM THE DESK OF MUSA GARUBA
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO


I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department 
of AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK BURKINA FASO. I got your contact address through 
internet net work search when searching for a good and reliable person that 
will assist me in this transaction.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of 22.85m US Dollars ( 
twenty two milllion eight hundred and Fifty thousand us dollars)in an 
account thatbelongs to one of our foreign customer who died on 25th JULY 
2001 IN SUPER SONIC CONCORDE plane crash AT CHARLES DE GAULLE AIRPORT IN 
PARIS FRANCE
along with his entire family.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed
next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving 
nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I 
decided to make this business proposal to you and release the money to you 
as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent 
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and i don't want this money to
go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after four year, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as 
next of kin to a foreigner.

I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in 
respect to the provision of a foreign account and 70% would be for ME;

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in
the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear 
as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this mail through 
my private line.
Your's faithfully
MR. MUSA GARUBA.
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
OUAGADOUGOU,BURKINA FASO
