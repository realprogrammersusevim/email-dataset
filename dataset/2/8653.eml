Attention: Friend,

I am Barrister Vincent Usman a Solicitor. I am the Personal Attorney to Mr.
John Anderson a foreigner, who was a contractor to Shell Petroleum
Development Company in Nigeria(SPDC). On the 26th of September 1992, my
client, his wife and their three children were involved in a Plane crash on
their way to Yankari Games Reserve for 2week`s holiday.

Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the plane crash, Since then I
have made several enquiries to his Embassy and the home address he filled
in his file in my office to locate any of his extended relatives, this has
also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I
decided to use the Internet to locate any member of his family but to no
avail, hence I contacted you.

I contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and property left
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable
by the SECURITY & FINANCE HOUSE where this fund is deposited. Particularly,
the FINANCE HOUSE where the deceased had an account valued at about US$9M
(Nine million dollars). Conseqently, the bank issued me a notice to provide
the next of kin or have the account confiscated.

since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 10 years
now. I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased
since you are a foreigner so that the proceeds of this account valued at
US$9M can be paid to you and I. We shall share the money thus 55% to me and
40% to you, while 5% will be used to re-imburse any expenses that might be
incurred on both ends and to service the tax that might incur be in your
country.

I have all the necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any
claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us
seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.

Yours Faithfully,

Barrister Vincent Usman(Esq).

N.B. Please indicate your telephone and fax numbers for easy communication
in this mutual transaction.
