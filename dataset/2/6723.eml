From: MR. ALBERT UGA.
Bills & Exchange Manager
                                             ATTEN:
                                                       RE:NEED FOR A
BENEFICIARY.

I am contacting you in regards to a business transfer of a huge sum of money
from a deceased account in my Bank.Though I know that a transaction of this
magnitude will make anyone apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that
all will be well at the end of the day.
I decided to contact you due to the urgency of this transaction and the need
for a foreign beneficiary.

PROPOSITION:

I discovered an abandoned sum of (US$28m) in an account that belongs to one of
our foreign customers who died along with his entire family.

Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay
claims to this money as the heir or beneficiary.The bank cannot release the
fund from his account unless a foreigner applies for claim as the next-of-kin
to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.

Upon this discovery, I now seek your permission to have you stand as a next of
kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worked out legally
by a high court lawyer for the funds (US$28m) to be approved in your favour and
transferred into your account as the beneficiary or next of kin to our late
customer.
If I do not transfer this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing
or reverted into the selfish  government purse.

It may interest you to note that I have secured from the probate an order of
madamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries.
I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the Bank
management is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct
information of this account,which I will give to you immediately,if you are
able and capable
to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to my
instructions and advice for our mutual benefit because this opportunity will
never come again in my life.

Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual business
endeavour by furnishing me with the following:

1. Your Full Names and Address.

2. Direct Telephone and Fax numbers.

These requirements will enable me file a letter of claim to the appropriate
departments for necessary approvals in your favour before the transfer can be
made.

I shall be compensating you with 30% of the total sum on final conclusion of
this project, while the rest shall be for me. Your share stays with you, while
the rest shall be for me for investment purposes in your country.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of the trust
I have bestowed on you, I await your urgent reply through this my private email
address mralbertuga@yahoo.fr to furnish you the details of this transfer.
I advise you call me for more information or if you have any question: 229-95-
40-35-48.

Regards and God bless,

MR. ALBERT UGA.
