Dear Friend, 
My name is LOI C.ESTRADA,The wife of Mr. JOSEPH
ESTRADA, the former President of Philippines located
in the South East Asia. My husband was recently
impeached from office by a backed uprising of mass
demonstrators and the Senate. My husband is presently
in jail and facing trial on charges of corruption,
embezzlement, and the mysterious charge of plunder
which might lead to death sentence.
The present government is forcing my husband out of
Manila to avoid demonstration by his supporter. During
my husband's regime as president of Philippine, I
realized some reasonable amount of money from various
deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to
invest this money for my children's future on real
estate and industrial production.
My husband is not aware of this because I wish to do
it secretly for now. before my husband was impeached,
I secretly siphoned the sum of $30,000,000
million USD (Thirty million United states dollars) out
of Philippines and deposited the money with a security
firm that transports valuable goods and consignments
through diplomatic means.
I am contacting you because I want you to go to the
security company and claim the money on my behalf
since I have declared that the consignment belong to
my foreign business partner. You shall also be
required to assist me in investment in your country. I
hope to trust you as a God fearing person who will not
sit on this money when you claim it, rather assist me
properly, I expect you to declare what percentage of
the total money you will take for your assistance.
When I receive your positive response I will
let you know where the security company is and the
payment pin code to claim the money which is very
important.
For now, let all our communication is by e-mail
because my line are right now connected to the
Philippines Telecommunication Network services.
Please also send me your telephone and fax number.
I will ask my son contact you to give you more details
on after i have received a responce from you.through this
email address  mrssliocestrada@netscape.net
Thank you and God bless you and family.
MRS LOI C ESTRADA
