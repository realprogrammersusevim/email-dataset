Dear Sir, 
Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad =
necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing =
the sum of $12.500.000 (twelve million and five hundred thousand =
dollars)inherited from my father's business reserve.
I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family; my father was an agriculturist. He =
became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was =
victimized by  President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was =
assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding =
the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the =
insecurity of both our lives and properties then decided to deposit the above =
sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become =
the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt,and the =
farmlands and machines seized; yet the government and it's loyalists are bent =
on making life difficult for us.
To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 15% =
of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or =
25% share for possible help on investing in any rentable sector.
thanks for your anticipated assistance. if you do not accept my offer,please =
in good fate treat with utmost confidentiality . A  quick reply with your =
name,telephone and fax numbers for further details will be highly =
appreciated.
Sincerely yours,
KATURA BANGA
