FROM: Mrs. Sarasabha Kadyrov 


ATTN: President/ C.E.O

 

Dear Sir,



My name is Sarasabha Kadyrov wife of the late Chechnya's
President, Akhmad Kadyrov who was assassinated on May 9
during a Victory Day celebration.  Right now, I am staying
in British island of Alderney.

I got your address from a friend who is in your countries
trade and commerce  although i did not tell her of my
intention

I am sending you this fax to ask for your assistance to
invest the sum of $60Million in a long-term business that
is viable, profitable and durable; wish will be directly
under your control. It, has ever been my husband dream to
invest in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabic as a true Muslim so,
I will want us to keep his dream alive.

I have prayed and Allah has directed me to you, I Hope to
receive your positive response on how to move this
investment forward. On your reply you should let me know
what plans you have for my investment capital currently in
a safe deposit Vault in cash. I will arrange for a business
meeting with you to finalize the areas of your investment
and financial disbursement. 

This fund was diverted from the Chechen treasury and
deposited in the Vault in cash on my name because my late
husband would not want anybody to know that he is
associated with the fund.  My primary objective is to move
this fund out of Europe as quickly as possible.  All
arrangement in this regard has been concluded and as soon
as you give your consent to take custody of this fund the
movement can be effected.

You should also let me have some details about yourself and
your business. I will also be able to give you further
details on my personal profile including contact details.

I am aware that, in order to undertake this responsibility
you should logically be entitled to some personal gratuity
which will be a percentage of the fund in question. Could
you please also indicate what your desired percentage would
be?

 

You can reach me on my email

 

Respectfully yours,

 

Mrs. Sarasabha Kadyrov
