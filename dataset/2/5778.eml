office monitors and controls the affairs of all banks and financial institutions=2E 
 I have before me list of funds=2C which could not be transferred to some nominated 

accounts as these accounts have been identified either as ghost accounts=2C unclaimed 

deposits and over-invoiced sum etc=3B I have the opportunity to write you based on 

the instructions among others i received days ago from the officer in the computer 

section in person of Engineer Peter Cliff=2Cto bring out part of your total pending 

payment with reference number=28LM-05-371=29 amounting US$10 million=2EThe =28Ten Million 

Dollars=29 is been arranged in a security-proof box weighing 75kg=2E In order to get 

the box shipped to you=2E
 As I found out that you have almost met all the statutory requirements in respect 

of your pending payment=2E The problems you are having is that of interest groups=2E A 

lot of people are interested in your payment and those people are merely doing 

paper works with you and that explains why you receive different kinds of untrue 

fax and phone messages from different people everyday=2E Also we found out that some 

of the officials of the parastatals have been extorting a lot of money from you 

with the pretext of helping you receive your money=2E I can assure you this will keep 

happening if you do not do away with those officers=2E For security reasons you do 

not have to tell anybody that your have your payment on the way until the payment 

gets to you=2E

to get this box shipped to you=2Cthe=28CSO=29and i Yesterday went to this four courier 

companies Dhl=2C Ems=2C FedEx and Ups to make arrangements on how to get the box 

shipped to you by courier=2C but to no avail the above courier companies all made us 

to understand that they will have to open the box for inspection by the customs 

before shipment=2E This is something we want to avoid because this box is been padded 

with synthetic nylon and to open it you will have to cut the pad before you will 

meet the button that you will press to open the dial code-lock=2E There is no way you 

can open the box and be able to close it again because it was padded with machine=2E  

We told the courier services that the box contained film materials and when open 

will spoil the materials=2E =3CN=3AB=3E we did not declare money because courier does not 

carry money=2E
 
 Today a friend of mine who is a diplomat disclosed to me that there is a security 

courier service company that is specialized in sending diplomatic materials and 

information from one country to another=2C which also has diplomatic immunity and 

consignment such as this cannot be checked by any customs anywhere in the world=2E I 

have therefore met the official of the security courier service and concluded 

shipping arrangement with them=2C which they will commence as soon as I have your go 

ahead order=2E The diplomat who will be bringing in this consignment to you is an 

expert and has been in this line of work for many years now so we have Notting to 

worry about=2E After all arrangements we have concluded that you must donate Five 

Hundred Thousand United States dollars =28US$500=2C000=2E00=29 to any charity organisation 

I designate as soon as you receive your money=2E To this effect=2C you will send to us 

a promissory note for the donation along with your address where you will like the 

box to be delivered to by the courier=2E Please maintain topmost secrecy as it may 

cause a lot of problems if found out that we are using this way to help you=2E You 

are advised not to inform anyone about this until you received your money=2E Am
