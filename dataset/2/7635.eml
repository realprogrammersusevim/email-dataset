                     CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know m=
e personally.I got your contact through network online hence decided to wri=
te you. I should have notified you about it at least for the sake of your i=
ntegrity. Please accept my apology. The purpose of my letter is to seek for=
 foreign assistance with regards my late father money. My name is Laurent N=
kono, the first son of  Nkono Banjul ,one of the most popular black farmer =
in Zimbabwe who was recently murdered in the land dispute in my country.
This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduc=
ed a new Land Act Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some f=
ew black farmers, and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbab=
wean war veterans and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people=
 were killed because of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of=
 the victims. . It is against this background that, I and my family fled Zi=
mbabwe for fear of our lives and are currently staying in the Netherlands w=
here we are seeking political asylum.
Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit t=
he sum of US8.5 million (Eight million, Five Hundred thousand United States=
 dollars), in one of the private security company, as he foresaw the loomin=
g danger in Zimbabwe this money was deposited in a box as gem stones to avo=
id much demurrage from security company. This amount was meant for the purc=
hase of new machines and chemicals for the Farms and establishment of new f=
arms in Swaziland.=20
Now the family have decided to transfer my father's money to a more reliabl=
e foreign account. since the law of Netherlands prohibits a refugee (asylum=
 seeker) to open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transa=
ction throughout the territorial zone of Netherlands, As the eldest son of =
my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreig=
n account where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my=
 government who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South Africa=
n government seems to be playing along with them hence I am faced with the =
dilemma of moving this amount of money out of South Africa for fear of goin=
g through the same experience in future and as you are aware both countries=
 have similar political history. As a businessman, I am seeking for a partn=
er who I have to entrust my future and that of my family in his hands, I mu=
st let you know that this transaction is risk free. Due to my current statu=
s in the Netherlands My lawyers shall work on my behalf to complete this tr=
ansaction with you.
=20
If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do for me, is t=
o make an arrangements with the security company to clear the consignment(f=
unds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as I have already=
 given directives for the consignment to be brought to the Netherlands from=
 South Africa. But before then all modalities will have to be put in place =
like change of ownership to the consignment and more importantly a concrete=
 arrangement for the investment of part of the funds thereafter the clearan=
ce from the Security Company.=20
I have two options for you. Firstly you can choose to have your percentage =
of the money immediately after the funds hit your account, or you can go in=
to partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of the money in=
 your country. Whichever the option you want, it is opened for negotiation.=
=20
I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses incurred =
in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a partnership I am=
 willing to give you 15% of the money while the remaining 80% will be for m=
y investment in your country. Please contact me as soon a possible via the =
above email address,  while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy =
required in this transaction.

Thanks, GOD BLESS YOU=20
Yours Faithfully,=20
