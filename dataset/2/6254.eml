<DIV class=RTE><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV class=RTE><STRONG>Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released&nbsp; unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately , all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. </STRONG><STRONG>It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to makethis businness proposal to you and release the money to&nbsp; you via your foreign bank account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money Could&nbsp; go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. </STRONG></DIV>
