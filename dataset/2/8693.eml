Dear Friend
 
My name is MRS=2EROHDA SAEED IBRAHIM from Iraq=2E I am married to DR=2E SAEED IBRAHIM=2C who worked with shell Petroleum Company in Iraq for twelve years before he died after a brief illness=2E 
We were married for eight years without a child=2E Since we married we were both Islamic couple members=2E After his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home=2E When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $9=2E5 Million =28Nine million five hundred thousand U=2ES=2EDollars=29 with International Diplomatic service firm in London with purpose to invest the fund in Islamic foundation or better Christian foundation before his death=2C The fund is still under safe keeping with the International Diplomatic firm in London=2C hence and contacting you to help me to achieve this project in your country=2E
 
 During the current war in my country=2C all the property and the assets of my husband were destroyed I don=92t have anything left on behalf of my husband except this fund that=92s deposited with the Diplomatic service company in London=2C now I=92m undergoing a serious illness that resulted to be stroke and cancer problem=2C I had tried all my best to treat myself with every medical expert but there is no improvement=2C Currently my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next six  months due to my cancer problems=2E Having known my condition=2C I decided to donate this fund to Mosque=2C Islamic School Authority or Better Christian foundation=2C individual=2C that will utilize this money the way I instruct here=2E
 
I want this fund to be distributed to=2C Orphanages=2C Widows promoting the work of almighty Allah=2C and to promote work of Almighty Allah in your country=2E The Koran made us to understand that blessed is the hand that gives=2E I took this decision because I don=92t have any child that will inherit this money and my husband=92s brothers are unbelievers=2E
 
If this fund spent to promote the work of Almighty Allah=2C better=2E I don=92t want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner=2E Hence the reasons for taking this bold decision=2E I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going=2E I know that I am going to be in the heaven=2E I don=92t need any telephone communication in this regard because my health and the presence of my husband relatives around me always=2C
I don=92t want them to know about this development=2E With Allah all things are possible=2E 
 
As soon as I receive your reply I will instruct the DIPLOMATIC operation manager and my husband lawyer to furnish you with more details on how to receive the fund=2E
I will also instruct him to issue you a letter of authority that will empower you as the original-beneficiary of this fund=2E I want Christians and the Muslims to always pray for me because in Almighty Allah I put my hope=2E My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Muslim=2E
 
Reply me through my alternative e-mail address=2C as you delay in your reply will give room in sourcing for another faith member for this same purpose=2E Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I instructed here=2E As=2C I am seriously ill and I will not be able to move around and do much due to the illness=2C I will really appreciate it=2C if you only contact me through my Email=3AAddress=3Arohda3=5Fsaeedibrahim=40yahoo=2Eco=2Euk
