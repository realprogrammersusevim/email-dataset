Abidjan Cote D'Ivoire
  
Dear,
  
It is my pleasure to write you after much consideration 
since telephone  communication can not be suitable enough 
to communicate to you at first.I am Miss Vivian Saja the 
only doughter of late Mr Mathew  Saja of Sierra-Leone (SL) 
I am 24 years of age. My late father was limited liability 
in Cocoa and Gold merchant in  Sierra-Leone before his 
untimely death. After his business trip to Abidjan-Cote 
d'Ivoire,to negociate on a cocoa and gold business he 
wanted to invest in Abidjan - Cote d'Ivoire.
  
A Week after he came back from Abidjan, he got an 
accidente with my mother of which my mother died instantly 
but my father died after five days in a private hospital 
on that faithful afternoon. I didn't know that my father 
was going to leave me after I had lost my  mother. 
But before he gave up the ghost, it was as if he knew he 
was going to die. He my father, MAY HIS SOUL REST IN 
PERFECT PEACE he disclosed to me that he deposited sum of 
$9.7,000,000,00 US Dollars (NINE MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED 
THOUSAND DOLLARS) in a Bank here in Abidjan- Cote 
d'ivoire.

That the money was meant for his cocoa and Gold company he 
wanted to establish in Abidjan - Cote d'Ivoire though, He 
single handed me the deposit certificate and instructed me 
to seek for a reliable and trust worthy business partner 
for my life time investment abroad. Now I have succeded in 
locating the bank here in Abidjan- Cote d'ivoire and also 
confirmed the bank with most honest and confidentiality. 
  Now I am soliciting for your assistance to help me lift 
this money out from Abidjan to your safe account abroad so 
that we should invest it in any meaningful lucrative 
business in your country because this is my only hope in 
life.
  
Awaiting anxiously to hear from you so that we can discuss 
the modalities of this transaction.  Please kindly contact 
me immediately  for more discussion.
  
Please don't hesitate to send me a message.Thanks for your 
kind attention.
  
Yours sincerely
Miss Vivian Saja
