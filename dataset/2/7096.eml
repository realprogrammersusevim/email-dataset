FROM THE DESK OF : MR ZAKI AHMED,
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING SECTION,
AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO,WEST AFRICA.
 
DEAR FRIEND,
 
I AM ZAKI AHMED, THE DIRECTOR IN CHARGE OF AUDITING AND 
ACCOUNTING SECTION OF AFRICAN DEVLOPMENT BANK (A.D.B) OUAGADOUGOU 
BURKINA-FASO WEST AFRICA WITH DUE RESPECT AND REGARD. I HAVE DECIDED TO 
CONTACT YOU ON A BUSINESS TRANSACTION THAT WILL BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO 
BOTH OF US AT THE END OF THE TRANSACTION.
 
DURING OUR INVESTIGATION 
AND AUDITING IN THIS BANK, MY DEPARTMENT CAME ACROSS A VERY HUGE SUM OF 
MONEY BELONGING TO A DECEASED PERSON WHO DIED ON OCTOBER 31ST 1999 IN A 
PLANE CRASH AND THE FUND HAS BEEN DORMANT IN HIS ACCOUNT WITH THIS BANK 
WITHOUT ANY CLAIM OF THE FUND IN OUR CUSTODY EITHER FROM HIS FAMILY OR 
RELATION BEFORE OUR DISCOVERY TO THIS DEVELOPMENT.
 
THE SAID AMOUNT 
WAS U.S 11.5M (ELEVEN MILLION FIVE HUNDRED UNITED STATES DOLLARS). AS 
IT MAY INTEREST YOU TO KNOW, I GOT YOUR IMPRESSIVE INFORMATION THROUGH 
THE BURKINA-FASO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ON FOREIGN BUSINESS RELATIONS HERE 
IN OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.
 
MEANWHILE ALL THE WHOLE ARRANGEMENT TO 
PUT CLAIM OVER THIS FUND AS THE BONAFIDE NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED, 
GET THE REQUIRED APPROVAL AND TRANSFER THIS MONEY TO A FOREIGN ACCOUNT 
HAS BEEN PUT IN PLACE AND DIRECTIVES AND NEEDED INFORMATION WILL BE 
RELAYED TO YOU AS SOON AS YOU INDICATE YOUR INTEREST AND WILLINGNESS TO 
ASSIST US AND ALSO BENEFIT YOUR SELF TO THIS GREAT BUSINESS 
OPPORTUNITY.
 
IN FACT I COULD HAVE DONE THIS DEAL ALONE BUT BECAUSE OF 
MY POSITION IN THIS COUNTRY AS A CIVIL SERVANT(A BANKER),WE ARE NOT 
ALLOWED TO OPERATE A FOREIGN ACCOUNT AND WOULD EVENTUALLY RAISE AN EYE 
BROW ON MY SIDE DURING THE TIME OF TRANSFER BECAUSE I WORK IN THIS 
BANK. THIS IS THE ACTUAL REASON WHY IT WILL REQUIRE A SECOND PARTY OR 
FELLOW WHO WILL FORWARD CLAIMS AS THE NEXT OF KIN WITH AFFIDAVIT OF 
TRUST OF OATH TO THE BANK AND ALSO PRESENT A FOREIGN ACCOUNT WHERE HE 
WILL NEED THE MONEY TO BE RE-TRANSFERRED INTO ON HIS REQUEST AS IT MAY 
BE AFTER DUE VERIFICATION AND CLARIFICATION BY THE CORRESPONDENT BRANCH 
OF THE BANK WHERE THE WHOLE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED FROM TO YOUR OWN 
DESIGNATION BANK ACCOUNT.
 
I WILL NOT FAIL TO INFORM YOU THAT THIS 
TRANSACTION IS 100% RISK FREE.ON SMOOTH CONCLUSION OF THIS TRANSACTION, 
YOU WILL BE ENTITLED TO 30% OF THE TOTAL SUM AS GRATIFICATION, WHILE 5% 
WILL BE SET ASIDE TO TAKE CARE OF EXPENSES THAT MAY ARISE DURING THE 
TIME OF TRANSFER AND ALSO TELEPHONE BILLS, WHILE 65% WILL BE FOR ME AND 
MY PARTNERS. PLEASE, YOU HAVE BEEN ADVICED TO KEEP "TOP SECRET" AS I AM 
STILL IN SERVICE AND INTEND TO RETIRE FROM SERVICE AFTER WE CONCLUDE 
THIS DEAL WITH YOU.
 
I WILL BE MONITORING THE WHOLE SITUATION HERE IN 
THIS BANK UNTIL YOU CONFIRM THE MONEY IN YOUR ACCOUNT AND ASK ME TO 
COME DOWN TO YOUR COUNTRY FOR SUBSEQUENT SHARING OF THE FUND ACCORDING 
TO PERCENTAGES PREVIOUSLY INDICATED AND FURTHER INVESTMENT, EITHER IN 
YOUR COUNTRY OR ANY COUNTRY YOU ADVICE US TO INVEST IN. ALL OTHER 
NECESSARY VITAL NFORMATION WILL BE SENT TO YOU WHEN I HEAR FROM YOU.
 
I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVE YOUR PHONE AND FAX NUMBERS FOR EASY 
COMMUNICATION,

YOURS FAITHFULLY,
MR.ZAKI AHMED.
