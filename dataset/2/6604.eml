<DIV class=RTE><STRONG>I am the manager of bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of BANK OF AFRICA. I am writting to seek your coperation over this business deal. </STRONG></DIV>

<DIV class=RTE><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV class=RTE><STRONG>Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because it cannot be released&nbsp; unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately , all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. </STRONG><STRONG>It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to makethis businness proposal to you and release the money to&nbsp; you via your foreign bank account as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and this money Could&nbsp; go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed Bill. </STRONG></DIV>

<DIV class=RTE><STRONG>Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged,you must apply first to the bank as the relation or next of kin to the deceased,indicating your claims and wherein the money will be remitted . </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV class=RTE><STRONG>Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of application which you will fill and submit to the office of the foreign remittance director of the bank of africa. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is stricly confidential and i will use my position in this Bank to effect a hitch free transfer of the fund. </STRONG></DIV>
