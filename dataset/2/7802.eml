forces from the United States America, I managed to move this funds out through United Nations who was in my country for inspection on chemical weapons to SOUTH AFRICA.
At the moment, I do not know when these problems will be over and I wouldnot want the funds to sit in the office of united nation for so long because of the demurrage levied against it by the agency in charge of the funds.
The funds so far is  under the watchful eyes of KM-BEKI ENTERPRISES affiliated with United Nations office in SOUTH AFRICA.

where my funds will be transferred to.
Thank you and Allah be with you.
