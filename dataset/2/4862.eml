            ( "REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS
                     CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE")

Compliment Of The Season,

On a very good day. I am (ASITA ALI)a senior
staff in file department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your
contact from a Yahoo Tourist Search.

When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of
your capability
and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when
i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an
abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A
dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who
died along with his entire family in (friday december 26,2003  ) in a
plane crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next
of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it
unless
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as
indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all
his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my
department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safet=
y
and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t
want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such
money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be
transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of
foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that
the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin
to a foreigner.

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for
;me and my woman colleague. There after I and my colleague will visit you=
r
country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of
the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account
number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective
communication and location where the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text o=
f
the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer.

You should contact me on my number 00226 76 52 47 43
immediately as soon
as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you
immediately.

Your=92s faithfully,
ASITA ALI

POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to
enable the transfer to move very smoothly in to the account you will prov=
e
to the bank.As you finished reading this letter call me
immediately so that we discuss very well over this business.Please call m=
e
and inform me that you received my mail, because i don't go to net always=
.
