Dear Friend,
I am Mrs. Maryam. Abacha, the widow of Sani Abacha the
Late Nigerian Head of State.
I am presently in distress and under house arrest
while my son Mohammed is undergoing trial in Lagos and
Abuja though he has just been recently granted bail under
the condition that my family refunds to the Federal
Government some amount of money. The government
has frozen all the family account and auctioned all our
properties.
Refer to this website about my husband's loot and you will
understand what I mean
<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1935646.stm>

To save the family from total bankruptcy I have
managed to ship through an undercover courier company,
the sum of US$32, 000,000.00. kept by my late husband. The
money was disguised to beat the Nigerian S! ecurity and it is 
currently deposited in a security company which I will disclose 
the name and contacts to you if I get a positive response from 
you. I want you to receive the money and pay into
your account for the family safely.
I am offering you 25% for assisting me secure this
money, Contact me immediately with my email address
so that I can forward to you all necessary details.
Endeavour to send your phone and fax numbers for easy
Communications. This project is not risky.
Best regards.
Mrs. Maryam. Abacha (Dr.)
