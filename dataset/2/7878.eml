Sir
 
I was privileged to come across your contact through my personal check on your country=92s 

business and investment portal and I decided that I should establish a communication with 

you to acquiring some information on lucrative investment or establishment in your country=2E
 
Be it as it may=2C I will appreciate if you can be of good assistance to me as I am willing to 

invest my money  in your country provided I will have a good partner or investor as well 

fund manager who will guide on this business framework and as thus=2C share with me the 

dividend in any venture which we have considered lucrative to invest in and I have not 

managed any business before but have always dreamt of running my own establishment hence my 

desire to invest in your country in blue chip ventures=2C production or real estate=2E
 
Further to this=2C I will like to give you a little more information about me=2C I am an 

American but married into the Sharjah Royal Family here in Sharjah United Arab Emirate=2C but 

at the moment undergoing a divorce suit with my husband through the sharia court and 

hopefully will get this matter over within a couple of weeks and that is why I want to calve 

a niche for myself to be able to continue with my life and make my life meaningful when I 

leave my husband=92s family=2E The funds I intend to invest with you are currently in a UAE bank 

here as was deposited by my late father who worked before he died as a chemical engineer in 

the Saudi Oil Corporation ARAMCO and later the Emirate National Oil Corporation ENOC=2E
 
My reason of trying to establish my own business is necessitated by the advent of my divorce 

suit with my husband and according to the sharjah marital law here=2C if my husband family 

gets any knowledge of the funds in the bank=2C they will take possession of the funds since my 

father used my name as the next of kin=2E
 
It is my wish to handle this matter privately under the most cautious legal arrangement to 

get the funds into your possession before we can commence any trade deal and therefore 

demand that you kindly give me a brief information about you with pictures=2C contact address 

and telephone numbers incase I want to call you =2E
the money in question =28US$9=2C750=2C000=29 was deposited into the bank about two years back before 

my father died of heart failure and ever since his death=2C my relationship with my husband 

has gone bad hence my decision to file for the divorce amongst other reasons which I shall 

let you know
A friend of mine advised that what we shall do is to portray you as an investor who has 

given that money to my father before he died for a crude oil lifting from the Saudi oil 

corporation but the deal was thwarted due to the sudden death of my father=2E
By this strategy=2C hire the services of a lawyer here who will secure a letter of 

administration notarized by the high court with a sworn affidavit of change of ownership and 

application to the bank for the release of the funds to you under the emirate inheritance 

law=2E This logistics is to get the funds transferred to you as the bonafide owner of the 

funds to avoid any implications that will not permit me as being married to the royal family 

to possess such chattel or estate of my late father in conformity with the sharia marital 

law=2E
So I hope you understand very well=2C the strategies and where you don=92t quite comprehend=2C do 

ask me for more clarifications and for your involvement I will pay you 15% of the total 

money for your consultancy and then we can invest the rest still under your supervision=2E Pls 

reply this mail at info=5Fpat=40z6=2Ecom

Mrs=2E Patricia Khalid ibn Saqr al Qasseemi
