PERSONAL/STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL
I am delighted to contact you on a private note based on your claim to your=
 contract fund, which has been programmed for transfer into your designated=
 bank account through my department.
I am hereby apologizing to you for the delay in releasing this fund into yo=
ur account, which was caused by me because of breach of agreement between m=
e and your so called partners in Nigeria who introduced you into this busin=
ess.
Your Nigeria partners approached me that they want to present you as a bene=
ficiary to this fund as it was an OVER-INVOICING made when they are awardin=
g contract to foreign firms. So after the negotiation, we unanimously agree=
d that they (your partners) would give me the sum of US$200,000.00(CASH) on=
 my acceptance to assist them to transfer the fund into your account. When =
I accepted the offer, they forwarded all your banking particulars to me for=
 onward transfer. As soon as I made some fruitful efforts on the business a=
nd demanded my US$200,000.00 as agreed, your partners deviated from the agr=
eement and decided to go through the International Remittance Department at=
 my back and made a change of your bank account in other to disappoint me a=
nd not knowing that the International Remittance Department is also under m=
y control. Then I got the knowledge of their evil plans and prove their ill=
icit efforts abortive. That is why for many months you have been pursuing t=
his payment, spending unnecessary funds to some fraudulent individuals in N=
igeria who claimed to be in charge to release your fund.
I want to re-emphasize to you that your funds is still with me and under my=
 control. Now with my whole heart, I want to enter into real business with =
you on a sincere agreement since your partners has disappear into tin-air a=
nd nowhere to be found and the fund is still floating in your name waiting =
for a proper documentation and claims.
1. On an agreement, I assure you that I am going to transfer this fund into=
 your account.
2. You will assure me of keeping my dealings with you to an utmost secretar=
y because of my position.
3. You will promise to give me 20% of the total fund as soon as the fund ge=
ts into your account with a written promissory note signed by you.
4. I will assist you in making a proper documentation to make claims genuin=
e, as a bonafide Foreign Contractor and beneficiary to the said fund.
5. Reconfirmation of your receiving bank account so as to avoid wrong remit=
tance.
6. Your private phone and fax numbers, this is important for confidential i=
ssues and payment release instructions.

and office to contact you and other contractors as reported by the Central =
Bank of Nigeria authorities. I advise you that henceforth, you should suspe=
nd any dealings from any group of person(s) either from the CBN or any othe=
