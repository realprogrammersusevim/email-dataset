Dear Friend,

Please accept my apology for contacting you this way, which was due to
the
urgency of my request. We are in need of a worthy business partner
abroad,
who can handle the investment of specified funds which have been lying
fallow for some time.

If you accept to work with me, you would be our foreign
partner to receive the said funds on our behalf, due to my sensitive
position in our place PLACE OF WORK, and also to hold it in some
investment
until i can travel to meet with you. At your request I will intimate
you
with the blueprint when I receive your mail.

NOTE: PLEASE FORWARD YOUR REPLY ONLY TO THIS MAIL BOX
STATED HERE: ge_mowel@dr.com
for security reasons and make sure you include your private telephone
number

for easy communication.
Hoping to hear from you soon.

Kind Regards
Gerian Mowel.
