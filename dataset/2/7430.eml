<FONT face="Arial" size="3" > Dear Friend,<BR>I am  MrAhmed Abu a Regional Supervisour with a<BR>NATIONAL TRUST SECURITY COMPANY in Abidjan. We had a foreign client<BR>(name with held) who deposited a huge sum of money (US$10.5million)  with our Company.<BR>Eventually, this client was among the victims of EGYPT AIR BOEING 767  FLIGHT NO.990 that crashed on the 31-10-1999 in U.S.A but, since then  we have not had any body coming for the claims as the next of kin. A  sitaution I have monitored closely with my position in the Company.  Now, having monitored this deposit and managed it over<BR>the years before his death, and hence nobody has showed up as the next  of kin for the past one year plus, I have removed the file to my  private volt.<BR>I now solicit for your assistance to present you as the next of kin as  every other arrangement has being concluded by me and I am only waiting  for a foreigner to enable me move the fund to his account.I will need  your private telephone
  and fax numbers and your full name and address  of company or residential so that i can computerise them to tally with  the next of kin collum in the certificate of deposit.<BR>This does not have any risk attached to it as all the internal  documentations will be handled by me. I therefore request you to  confirm your interest by a return message and I will furnish you with  details.Lastly for the immediate take off of this transaction you have  to confirm your willingness and readiness to assist me retrive this  deposit.<BR>I look forward to hearing from you.<BR><BR>Regards<BR>Ahmed Abu<BR></FONT><P><HR size=1 noShade>For e-mail in Indian languages & English visit: <A href="http://www.e-tapaal.com" target="_blank">www.e-tapaal.com</A>
