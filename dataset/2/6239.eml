I greet you in the name of our lord. My name is MRS ROSELINE MULEKO, I
am a
widow and a mother of Two all girls. I know you will see my letter to
you as
an embarrassment considering the fact that we do not know ourselves,
from
Adam, but,plead with you to be patient with me. Well,I feel very
pleased to
contact you for some assistance and business relationship.

I live in South Africa with my children. My late husband was a loving,
caring and hardworking businessman who died unfortunately In a ghastly
autocrash.

Before the sudden death of my beloved husband, and father of my
daughters,
my late husband intended to establish a business, Abroad with the sum
of$8.5
million united states dollars, but unfortunately he died before this
proposed venture.

Following his death, his family members insisted that I am not entitled
to
his property (Assets and money) since I am a woman and my offspring's
all
girls as I do not have a male child for my husband. Well, according to
barbaric traditional laws here in this partof Africa which doesn't
entitled
a woman to inherit a man's property, as they are expected by tradition
to
take over the management of his business and other properties including
myself who automatically becomes a wife to one of his immediate
brothers.

Unfortunately to this wicked family members, the $8.5million united
states
dollars which my late husband intended to use in establishing a
business in
Overseas was deposited in a bank account unknown to his family.I and
his
Banking Officer are the only ones aware of this money,so I have
discussed this matter with a her in the bank that I want this money
personally so
that I will be able to take care of my children's educational needs
since my
husband's family members vehemently opposed the furtherance of their
education. According to the officer of the bank, the best way to
securethis
money is to remit this money to a foreign bank designate outside our
country
for safe-keeping, later it will be expended for future business
investment subject to the Advise of whosoever finally assists us.

At this juncture, Ithere fore ask for your kindest and sincere
assistance in
providing us with the following details, according to the officer in
the
Bank-


1.Full Name:
2.Address:
3.Marital Status:
4.Occupation:

And these will be in the enablement to facilitate the remittance of
this
fund into your nominated account. As soon as I get your positive
response, I
shall provide you with all the necessary detail for this Remitance.

However, I have decided to  give you 30% of the total money as a reward
for
your sincere assistance and the remaining 70% of the money will be for
our
both mutual investment as I will want to keep aglow my late husbands
dream
of investing in real estate and other lucrative ventures.
