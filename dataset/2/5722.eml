Dearest one,

I am Mr Basma Kouakou,the only Son of late chief Swarray Kouakou
from Sierra Leone.My sources of your contact gave me the courage andconfi=
dence
to rely on you. I am writing you in absolute confidence primarily to seek=

your assistance to transfer our cash of Sixteen million united state doll=
ars
(us$16,000,000)
now in the custody of a BANK here in Abidjan to your private account pend=
ing
our arrival to your country.

SOURCE OF THE MONEY My late father, chief Swarray Kouakou, a native of
mende district in the Northern province of Sierra Leone, was the general
Manager of Sierra Leone mining co-operation (S.L.M.C.) Freetown. Accordin=
g
to my father. This money was the income accrued from mining co-operation'=
s
over
draft and minor sales. Before the peak of the civil war between the rebel=
s
forces of major Paul Koroma and the combined forces of ECOMOG peace keepi=
ng
operation that almost destroyed my country, following the forceful remova=
l
from power of the Civilian Elected President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah by the re=
bels.
My father had already made arrangement for his family, my mother, my litt=
le
sister and myself to be evacuated to Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire with our pers=
onal
effects and the box containing team. My father deposited the fund for the=

safe custody until after the war when he will join us. During the war in
my country, and following the indiscriminate looting of public and Govern=
ment
properties by the rebel forces, the sierra Leone mining coop. Was one of
the targets looted and destroyed.

My father including other top Government functionaries Were attacked and
killed by the rebels in November 1999 because of his relationship with th=

civilian Government of Ahmed Tejan Kabbah. As a result of my father death=
