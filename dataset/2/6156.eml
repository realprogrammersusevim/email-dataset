investigation it was also discovered that Gen=2E Ibrahim Moussa did not 

declare any next of kin in his official papers including the paper work 

of his bank deposit=2E And he also confided in me the last time he was at 

my office that no one except me knew of his deposit in my bank=2E

So=2C Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still 

lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it=2E What 

bothers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at 

the expiration 3 years the funds will revert to the ownership of the 

Ghana Government if nobody applies to claim the funds=2E Against this

shall come out successful=2E I have contacted an attorney that will 

prepare the necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin 

to Gen=2E Ibrahim Moussa=2C all that is required from you at this stage is 

for you to provide me with your Full Names and Address so that the 

attorney can commence his job=2E After you have been made the next of 

kin=2C the attorney will also fill in for claims on your behalf and 

secure the necessary approval and letter of probate in your favor for 

the move of the funds to an account that will be provided by you=2E

There is no risk involved at all in the matter as we are going adopt a 

Legalized method and the attorney will prepare all the necessary 

documents=2E Please endeavor to observe utmost discretion in all matters 

concerning this issue=2E Once the funds have been transferred to your
