Attention=3AThe President=2FCEO=2E

I am barrister David Clovis =28Esq=2E=29=2C an English speaking Senegalese Solicitor & Financial Attorney=2FConsultant=2EI was the personal attorney to late Daniel Thorp who was an expatriate mining consultant=2Fcontractor with Teaser Petroleum Corporation in St Louis-Senegal=2EMr=2E Daniel Thorp here-in-after referred as my client was also a Diamond=2FGold Merchant=2E

Mr=2EDaniel Thorp made a numbered time =28Fixed=29 deposit for US$12=2C500=2C000=2E00 =28Twelve Million Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars Only=29 in a bank in Dakar=2C capital of Senegal with standing statement=2Fagreement with the bank that all correspondences in respect to the fixed deposit contract must be sent to him through my humble chambers=2E Upon maturity=2C the routine notification was sent to me whom I dispatched to his forwarding address as usual without no reply=2E After a month=2C I sent areminder which I received from the bank without any reply again=2E 

Finally=2C I discovered from my client=92s contract employers- Teaser Petroleum Corporation that he died among many others in the Kenya Airways flight of 31st January=2C 2000 that crashed into the Atlantic Ocean in Abidjan=2C Cote D=92Ivoire=2E On further investigations=2C I found out that he died without making any WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless=2E I also discovered that Mr=2E Daniel Thorp did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents=2C including his fixed deposit contract with the bank in Dakar-Senegal=2E

I am contacting you based on the official letter I just received from his bankers reminding me that Senegalese law states that at the expiration of 5 =28five=29 years the money will revert to the ownership of the Senegalese Government if I do not confirm the next of kin to claim the fund=2E 

Consequently=2C my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kinto Mr=2E Daniel Thorp so that the fruits of this old man=92s labor will not go into the hands of some corrupt government officials=2E Note that this transaction is simple and risk free because I will provide expert legal services that will guarantee the successful execution of this deal=2E

I wish to point out that after the claims=2C I would want 20% of this money to be shared among charity organizations=2C while the remaining 80% is shared equally between us=2E Most importantly=2C I would also require your assistance towards investing my share in your country or anywhere as you may advice=2E 

If you are interested=2C please contact me via my email address =3Adavidchambers=40katamail=2Ecom=2E Upon your response=2C I shall provide you with more details and how we shall proceed with the claims=2E I expect you to observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction would be profitable for both of us=2E
