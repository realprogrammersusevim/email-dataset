MRS JULLIET ABRAMS
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
HEADQUARTERS
COTONOU
REPUBLIC OF BENIN=2E
 
I am MRS JULLIET ABRAMS=2C credit officer of African
Development Bank=2E I have an urgent and very
confidential business proposition for you=2E

In June=2C 1998=2C a British Oil consultant=2Fcontractor
with the West African's oil and Solid Minerals
Corporation=2C Mr=2E David Van Buskirk made a numbered
time =28Fixed=29 Deposit for twelve calendar 
months=2C valued at US$35=2C000=2C000=2E00=28Thirty five Million United States Dollars only=29 in my branch=2E Upon maturity=2CI sent a routine notification 
to his forwarding address but got no reply=2E After a
month=2C we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers=2C the West African oil and
Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr=2EDavid Van Buskirk
died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st
October=2C 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other
passengers on board=2E

On further investigation=2CI found out that he died
without making a WILL=2C and hitherto=2C all attempts to
trace his next of kin was fruitless=2E Mr=2EDavid Van
Buskirk was residing at No 1 Rue de Avenida=2C G=2ER=2EA=2E
Cotonou=2C Benin Republic=2E

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr=2EDavid Van Buskirk did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents=2C including his
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank=2E This sum of
US$35=2C000=2C000=2E00 is still sitting in my 
Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year=2E No one will
ever come forward to claim it=2E According to Laws of
Benin=2C at the expiration of 5 =28five=29 years=2C the money
will be declared frozen and forfeited to the  
Benin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund=2E

Consequently=2C my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin or business
partner to Mr=2EDavid Van Buskirk so that 
the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into
the hands of some corrupt government officials=2E This

the attorney will prepare the necessary 
documents and affidavits that will put you in place as

the services of an attorney for drafting 
and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate=2Fadministration in your favor for the transfer=2E

A bank account in any part of the world that you will
provide will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary=2Fnext of kin=2E

The money will be paid into your account for us to
share in the ratio of 65% for me=2C 30% for you and 5%
for expenses incurred in the course of the

We could also use an ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY in
Europe to secure this funds and transfer to your

transaction will be done legitimately and with my
