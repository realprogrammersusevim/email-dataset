MRS JULLIET ABRAMS
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
HEADQUARTERS
COTONOU
REPUBLIC OF BENIN=2E
 
I am MRS JULLIET ABRAMS=2C credit officer of African
Development Bank=2E I have an urgent and very
confidential business proposition for you=2E

In June=2C 1998=2C a British Oil consultant=2Fcontractor
with the West African's oil and Solid Minerals
Corporation=2C Mr=2E David Van Buskirk made a numbered
time =28Fixed=29 Deposit for twelve calendar 
months=2C valued at US$35=2C000=2C000=2E00=28Thirty five Million United States Dollars only=29 in my branch=2E Upon maturity=2CI sent a routine notification 
to his forwarding address but got no reply=2E After a
month=2C we sent a reminder and finally we discovered
from his contract employers=2C the West African oil and
Solid Minerals Corporation that Mr=2EDavid Van Buskirk
died in an air crash along with his wife on the 31st
October=2C 1999 in an Egyptian airline 990 with other
passengers on board=2E

On further investigation=2CI found out that he died
without making a WILL=2C and hitherto=2C all attempts to
trace his next of kin was fruitless=2E Mr=2EDavid Van
Buskirk was residing at No 1 Rue de Avenida=2C G=2ER=2EA=2E
Cotonou=2C Benin Republic=2E

I therefore made further investigation and discovered
that Mr=2EDavid Van Buskirk did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents=2C including his
Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank=2E This sum of
US$35=2C000=2C000=2E00 is still sitting in my 
Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the
principal sum at the end of each year=2E No one will
ever come forward to claim it=2E According to Laws of
Benin=2C at the expiration of 5 =28five=29 years=2C the money
will be declared frozen and forfeited to the  
Benin Government if nobody applies to claim the fund=2E

Consequently=2C my proposal is that I will like you as a
foreigner to stand in as the next of kin or business
partner to Mr=2EDavid Van Buskirk so that 
the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into
the hands of some corrupt government officials=2E This

the attorney will prepare the necessary 
documents and affidavits that will put you in place as
the next of kin or business partner=2E We shall employ
the services of an attorney for drafting 
and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the
necessary documents and letter of
probate=2Fadministration in your favor for the transfer=2E

A bank account in any part of the world that you will
provide will then facilitate the transfer of this
money to you as the beneficiary=2Fnext of kin=2E

The money will be paid into your account for us to
share in the ratio of 65% for me=2C 30% for you and 5%
for expenses incurred in the course of the

We could also use an ASSET MANAGEMENT COMPANY in
Europe to secure this funds and transfer to your
account in your country=2E

transaction will be done legitimately and with my
