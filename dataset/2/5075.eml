FROM MR ABDUL LAZEEZ
STANDARD TRUST BANK OF BENIN
REPUBLIC OF BENIN. 
WEST AFRICA.
 
DEAR FRIEND
  I am MR ABDUL LAZEEZ, the director in charge of auditing and accounting=
 section of Standard trust bank of Benin cotonou Republic of Benin in Wes=
t Africa with due respect and regard. I have decided to contact you on a =
business transaction that will be very beneficial to both of us at the en=
d of the transaction . 
 
During our investigation and auditing in this bank,my department came acr=
oss a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who died in (=
beirut-bound charter jet) plane crash on the 25th December 2003 here in c=
otonou (replublic of benin) and since his untimely death the funds has be=
en dormant in his account with this Bank without any claim of the fund in=
 our custody either from his family or relation before our discovery to t=
his development.You shall read more news about the crash on visiting this=
 site which I got during my investigation; (http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD=
/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html). 
Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself and par=
tners to enable the whole plans and idea be Profitable and successful dur=
ing the time of execution. The said amount was US$24.1M(Twenty Four milli=
on One
Hundred Thousand united states dollars). 
As it may interest you to know, I got your impressive information through=
 a friends who works with the Ministry of Information here in Cotonou-Ben=
in. 
 
It is him who recommended your person to me to be viable and capable to c=
hampion a business of such magnitude without any problem .Meanwhile all t=
he whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bonafide next of =
kin to the deceased,get the required approval and transfer this money to =
a foreign account has been put in place and directives and needed informa=
tion will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest and wil=
lingness to assist us and also benefit yourself to this great business op=
portunity. 
 
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my position in t=
his country as a civil servant,we are not allowed to operate a foreign ac=
count and would eventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time o=
f transfer because I work in this bank.
This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow wh=
o will forward claims as the next of kin to the Bank and also present a f=
oreign account where he will need the money to be re-transferred into on =
his request as it may be after due verification and clarification by the =
correspondent branch of the bank where the whole money will be remitted f=
rom to your own designated bank account. 
 
May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as =
I have made arrangements for a successful arrangement as an insider of th=
e bank before contacting you. On smooth conclusion of this transaction, y=
ou will be entitled to 30% of the total sum as gratification, while 10% w=
ill be set aside to take care of expenses that may arise during the time =
of transfer and also telephone bills, while 60% will be for me and my par=
tners. 
 
Please, you have been adviced to keep this a top secret as we are still i=
n service and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal w=
ith you. 
 
I will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you conf=
irm the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for=
 subsequent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indic=
ated and further investment, either in your country or any country you ad=
vice us to invest in. 
 
All other necessary information will be sent to you on your acceptance to=
 champion this transaction with me. 
 
I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible on my personal email add=
ress stating your wish in this deal. 
Yours faithfully, 
Mr ABDUL LAZEEZ
