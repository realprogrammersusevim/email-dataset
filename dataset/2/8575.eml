Beloved in the Lord Jesus Christ, PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE
CHILDREN OF GOD.

My name is Mother Doris Killam 63years old woman from United States of
America. I am married to Engineer Pitt Killam who till his death Worked
with Willbros, a U.S oil Engineering firm here in Nigeria, we were
married for Thirteen (13) years without a child.

He died on Saturday, 18 February 2006 after my late husband Eng. Pitt
and Eight (8) other foreign oil workers were abducted by militia groups
active in the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria, on the process of
negotiation by the Nigerian Government and the Militant Group
unfortunately, my
husband Eng. Pitt Killam died, before his death, we deposit a sum of
$2.5 Million Dollars which was proceed of a contract work he just
concluded with the Nigerian Ports authority.

PLEASE FIND FACT ON THE INFORMATION FROM THE WEBSITE BELOW.

After his painful death I decided not to re-marry or get a child
outside my matrimonial home. My Doctor told me that I would not last
for the
next three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most
is my partial stroke as a result of high blood pressure.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this funds to church or
better still a Christian individual that will utilize this money the
way
I am going to instruct herein. I want a church or individual that will
use this money to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the
word of God and to ensure that the house of God is maintained.

The Bible made us to understand that blessed is the hand that grivet. I
took this decision because I dont have any child that will
inherit
this money and my husband's relatives are not Christians and I
dont
want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I
dont want a situation where this money will be used in an
ungodly
manner, hence the reason for taking this bold decision.

I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I
am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the
lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. With God all things
are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I will want you to give
me
your

Name:...........................
Address:........................
Sex/age:........................
Phone:..........................
Occupation:.....................

I will send a copy to the bank. For identification when you will
contact them. I want you and the church to always pray for me because
the
lord is my shepherd and I shall not want.

My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Please
assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated herein.

Note: this must be kept confidentially from eyes and ears of my
husband's family. Hoping to hear from you.

Reply me and Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.

Regards,
Mrs. Doris Killam.
