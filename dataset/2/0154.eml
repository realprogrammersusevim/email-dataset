The 
Government of India has recently mandated the Conditional
Access System for 
distribution of satellite television channels. This has
created a whole new

made an act, it will 
be mandatory for cable operators to distribute pay channels
through a set-top 
box.India has an estimated 38
million cable homes! The 
implementation of this change will require massive
investments in set-top boxes, 
conditional access software and the upgradation of headend
networks - a great 
oppotunity for you to tap this huge market!! Exhibiting your

11th Convergence India exhibition will give you an
