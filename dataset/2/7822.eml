DEAR ,

My name is Mrs.ANNA WILLIAM  I am a dying woman who have decided to donate 
what I have to you/ church. I am 59 years old and I was diagnosed for cancer 
about 2 years ago, immediately after the death of my husband,who had left me 
everything he worked for.I have been touched by God to donate  from what I 
 have inherited from my late husband to  you for the good work of God,rather 
than allow my relatives to use my husband hard earned funds ungodly.

Please pray, that the good Lord forgive me my sins. I have asked God to 
forgive me and i believe he has because He is a merciful God.I will be going 
in for an operation in less than four hours.I decided to
WILL/donate the sum of $9,500,000(Nine Million Five hundred thousand 
Dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and also to help the 
motherless and less privilege and also for the assistance of the widows 
according to (JAMES 1:27). At the moment I cannot take any telephone calls 
right now due to the fact that my relatives are around me and my health 
status. I have adjusted my WILL and my lawyer is aware i have changed my 
will and you and my lawyer will arrange the transfer of the funds the 
Security Company. 

I wish you all the best and may the Good Lord bless you  abundantly, and 
please use the funds well and always extend the Good work to others. Contact 
my lawyer with this specified email: barr_onome@mail2lawyer.com ,  with this 
subject (Mrs.A.W.Will) and tell him that I have WILLED ($9,500,000.00) to 
you the above funds and i have also notified him that I am WILLING that 
amount to you for a specific and Good work. I know I don't know you but I 
have been  directed to do this. Thanks and God bless.

NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until
the task is accomplished as I don't want anything that will Jeopardize my 
last wish.I have instructed my Lawyer to process all legal documents and 
send them to you as my Beneficiary.

Remained blessed in thy Lord,

Truly Yours,
Mrs.ANNA WILLIAM
