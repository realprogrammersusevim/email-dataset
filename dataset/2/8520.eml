I am the wife of Ndoga Mupesa, my husband was allegedly killed by government of President Mugabe for supporting the Movement for Democratic Change, visit this website and see how they killed my husband.
http://www.1freespace.com/beetee/apr07_2001.html.
 
However, on the eve of my husband's death in April 5. 2001, he gave me the sum of US$39million in cash to move to Lebanon,but immediately my husband died I moved the funds to security company through a diplomatic courier service to europe.
 
The funds have been in the security company since April 5.2001.Because of the restriction placed on me and my children by the government of President Robert Mugabe, I Simply cannot travel to secure this funds from the security company where this said amount was deposited.
 
please As soon as you confirm to me by email  jane33mupesa@yahoo.com your readiness to assist me,I will fax a copy of my Power of Attorney to the security company to authorizing them to release the funds to you.
 
As soon as you have the funds in your custody, I will give you my account details in the Bahamas where you will transfer my funds to on mybehalf and You will be entitled to 20% of the total sum involved for your assistance.

 
Please contact me immediately .
 
Sincerely.
Mrs Jane Mupesa.
