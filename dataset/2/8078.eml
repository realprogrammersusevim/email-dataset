Dear Friend=2C 

Let me start by introducing myself properly to you=2E I 
am Alhaji Yusuf Adamah=2C I work with the United Bank 
for Africa UBA as an account officer in the Treasury=2F
Credit Control Unit=2E I came to know you in private search
for a reliable and reputable person to handle this confidential 
transaction=2C which involve the transfer of a huge sum of 
money into a foriegn account requiring maximum confidence=2E 

I must solicit your confidence in this transaction=2C by virtue of 
its nature that is utterly confidential and secret=2E Though I know
that a transaction of this magnitude will make any one 
apprehensive and worried=2C but I am assuring you that all will be 
well at the end of the day=2E I decided to contact you due to the
fact that this transaction is urgent=2C as I will rely on your ability in
handling a transaction of this nature=2E 

THE NATURE OF THE PROPOSITION =2F TRANSACTION=3A
A foreigner by name Andreas Schranner =2C who is a real 
estate and property developer by profession executed certain
contract=2Fsupply with the Government of the Federal Republic
of Nigeria in 1998=2E The payment for the executed contract had 
been approved and deposited with our bank in an Escrow account 
with us at UBA and had a closing balance as at the end of January 
2000=2C which is worth =28$27M=29 Twenty seven Million United States Dollars=2E

I was his personal account officer and since the government deposited 
this money with us in the year 1999=2C We were instructed by my late 
client that the money be kept and secured in a security and finance firm 
because it was less expensive to keep and secure the funds in the 
security firm devoid of tax payments=2E 

I am sad to inform you that Mr Andreas Schranner=2C his wife=2C daughter=2C 
daughter inlaw and children died in the ill fated concorde flight AF4590 
that crashed into Hotelisimmo on the 31st of July 2000 in Paris-France=2E

beneficiary to his assets with the bank as accordingto banking laws=2C 
such fund which has stayed more than 5 years without any claim will be 
terminated and be used by the bank as unclaimed fund=2E Mean while=2C as is 
personal account officer valuable efforts has being made by me for more than 
three years to get in touch with any of my late client family or relatives without 
any success=2EIt is because of the percieved impossibility of being able to locate 
any of my late client Next of Kin as his wife Maria Schranner and his daughter
Eich Andreas perished in the flight also=2E 

Based on this=2C I secretly seek advice from a fellow coleague who has being in 
banking for about 14 years now about this issue of my late client =2C he made me 
understand that things like this do happen and at the end of the day the chairman 
and board of directors of the bank will declare the funds as '' Unclaimed '' and 
subsequently divert it for thier personal use=2E In order to avert this negetive 
development=2C I now seek your permission to have you stand as the Next of Kin 
to my late client=2C so that the funds will be released and paid into your account as 
the beneficiary Next of Kin=2E

of your acceptance=2C I will furnish you with the necessary modalities of the transaction=2E

getting this funds to your account=2C I shall take a trip to meet with you in your country 
and the money will be shared on a 85% for me and 15% for you=2E We could go into
joint investment based on your advice=2E
