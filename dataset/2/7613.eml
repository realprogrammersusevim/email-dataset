company oversea to be precise in Holland=2C
but due to my present bad condition of health as I
am suffering from Cancer of the breast its quite
impossible for me to travel that distance to receive

To this effect I have writen a letter throgh my

a total foreigner to achieve my aim=2E
Atleast had it been that during the period of our
marriage we could produce any child=2C my late
husband was very wealthy and after his death=2C his
offspring will inherited all his business and wealth=2E
 
I got your contact through a desperate and personal
search on the web=2C for someone

this  wealth to the propagation of islam and in
assisting the less-privileged Muslim faithful in

will back you up for the transfer of
the money in your name as the beneficiary only if
