Dear friend=2C

It is indeed my pleasure to write to you this letter=2C
which I believe will be a suprise=2Cas we are both
complete strangers=2E As you read this=2CI don't want you
to feel sorry for me=2C because I believe everyone will
die someday=2E My name is Raad Ibrahim=2C a former
merchant in Dubai=2C in the U=2EA=2EE=2E=28United Arab
Emirates=29=2C I have been diagnosed with Esophageal
cancer which was discovered very late=2C due to my
laxity in caring for my health=2E

It has defiled all forms of medicine=2C and right now I
have only about a few months to live=2C according to
medical experts=2E I have not particularly lived my life
so well=2C as I never really cared for anyone not even
myself but my business=2E Though I am very rich=2C I was
never generous=2C I was always hostile to people and
only focus on my business as that was the only thing I
cared for=2C but now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have
or make all the money in the world=2E

I believe when I have a second chance to come to this
world I would live my life a different way from how I
had lived it=2C now that it is dark for me=2C I have
willed and given most of my properties and assets to
my immediate and extended family members and as well
as a few close friends=2E To correct my wrong past life=2C 
I have decided to give alms to charity organizations=2C 
as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on 
earth=2E So far=2C I have distributed money to some charity
organizations in the U=2EA=2EE=2C Algeria and Malaysia=2E Now
that my health has deteriorated so badly=2C I cannot do
this my self anymore=2E

I once asked members of my family to close one of my
accounts and distribute the money which I have there
to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan=2C they
refused and kept the money to themselves=2E Hence=2C I do
not trust them anymore=2C as they seem not to be
contended with what I have left for them=2E The last of
my money which no one knows of is the huge cash
deposit of 15=2C000=2C000 million dollars=2C =28fifteen
million dollars=29=2C that I have with a Fiducial Company
in Europe I will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and
you must be sending me information of how it was
disbursed either by email to=3Araadibrahim004=40netscape=2Enet 
or otherwise=2E
 
10% of the funds=2815 million=29=2C will be for your time and patience=2C
logistics and overhead=2E

I wait in anticipation for your response=2E

Thanks=2C

Raad Ibrahim=2E
