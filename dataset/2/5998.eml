I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualise this transaction=2E The deal in brief is that the funds with which to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account in the Nigerian apex bank and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country or any safe account outside your country in a convenient bank account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use=2E For this you shall be considered to have executed a contract for the ministry=2E The contract sum of which shall run into US$15=2E5Million of which your share shall be 30% if you agree to be our overseas agent=2E Your area of specialisation does not matter in this transaction=2C all that is required of you is a safe account and your willingness to assist us =2E As soon as payment is effected and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account=2C we intend to use o!
 ur own share in acquiring some estates abroad=2E For this too=2C you shall serve as our agent =2E It might interest you to note that last year=2C a similar transaction was carried out with one MR=2E CHIENCHEN YU of Taiwan but after securing the payment approvals=2C and payment effected=2C MR=2ECHIENCHEN YU changed his numbers and addresses=2C and was no where to be found on our getting to Taiwan=2E 
That was how we lost US$7=2E5Million=2E So this time around =2C I will be with you before the remmittance is made into your provided account to avoid future occurrence and allow trust to play a very minimal role until performance is seen=2E You are requested to communicate your acceptance or otherwise of this proposal=2C through email=2E
After which we shall discuss in details the modalities for seeing this transaction through=2E If however=2C you are not disposed to assist=2C kindly destroy this letter in view of the confidentiality of the proposed transaction and
