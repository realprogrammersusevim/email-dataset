Attn.

This mail may come as a surprise to you for we have neither met 
nor seen each other.
I got your contact through a discrete enquiry.

I 
am Mr. chuks ohakanu of the First National Bank of South Africa,here in 
Johannesburg.
I work with the Audit department as an Executive 
Accountant.
I am married with three kids.
I discovered an account that 
has been dormant for the last seven years, In the course of my work.
I 
further investigated the account and found out that the owner,Mr 
Arthur 
Dennis,from German,died in an auto crash  on 7th May,1998.
On 
subsequent inquiries,I learnt that he died without a heir or a will.
If 
unclaimed,these funds(Sixteen Million U.S Dollars,$16m) shall be 
recovered by the 
Government as unclaimed funds.
I am offering to do 
this business with you based on the records you possess as honest 
And 
God fearing..
All you are required to do is present an account where 
this money shall be moved.An already existing account can serve or  you 
set up a new one for this.to the deceased.I shall process all required 
legal documents to buttress this.
The bank shall release the funds to 
you,then I shall come over to your country for the sharing of the money 
and subsequent investment potentials.
If you are interested,do not 
hesitate to mail me, so that I can give you the next step.I am offering 
you 35% of this money.5% for charity and 5% to cover any expenses 
either parties may have incurred during the course of this transaction.
I shall then keep 55% to myself for investment purposes.
I am earnestly 
waiting for  your response and believing that you shall not let me down 
during or after this transaction.
Regards,
Mr. chuks ohakanu
