<DIV><STRONG>Good day<BR>&nbsp; <BR>My name is Denis Messou,from the Republic of Cote D Ivoire.&nbsp; I am the only son of late Mr and Mrs .Jean Claude Messou, a wealthy cocoa farmer before he was poisoned to death by his associates on one of their outings to discuss a business.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Mother died earlier in 2001 so my father took me so special being his only son.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a proposition that I am making to you and I know that by the Grace of God you will not disappoint me.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Before the death of my Father in June,2004 in a pivate hospital here in Abidjan,he told me in his sick bed that he deposited the sum of $6.5 millions&nbsp;&nbsp; (Six Million Five Hundred Thousand Dollars) in a Term Deposit Account&nbsp; with a Bank here for onward transfer abroad for Investment.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; He advised me that in case he dies,I 
should look for an honest&nbsp; Investor who can help me transfer and invest this money abroad.&nbsp; He feared that those who killed him may equally not like to see me alive.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; I have been thinking about this for sometime now so that is why I am&nbsp; writing you to see if you can help me provide your Account where this&nbsp; money will be transferred and also help me look for investment prospects in your Country.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; I dont have any idea how this is done so I will like to do all the&nbsp; process until the money is transferred into your account. I am willing to conceed (15%) percent of this amount to you for your assistance and the rest,minus (5%) percent for any expenses that may come&nbsp; up,will go for the investment.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; I have not told anybody about this except you so I would please ask&nbsp; you to keep this 
strictly to your self for my personal safety. If this is okay by you,you can please&nbsp;&nbsp; send me an email through this mailbox.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Thank you and anticipating to hear from you.<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>&nbsp; Yours sincerely<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp; <BR>Denis Messou</STRONG></DIV></DIV></DIV></div><br clear=all><hr>Windows Desktop <a href="http://g.msn.com/8HMBFR/2755??PS=47575" target="_top">: retrouvez tout sur votre PC en un clin d'oeil !</a> </html>
