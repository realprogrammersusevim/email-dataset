Dear friend. 
I am Mr Henry Kabore manager audit account department of African Developm=
ent Bank(A.D.B.) .
In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of NINTEEN MILLION, THREE=
 HUNDRED THOUSAND UNITED STATES DOLLARS ($19,300,000.00 ) in an account t=
hat belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire=
 family in an aeroplane crash.
Since the bank got information about his death we have been expecting his=
 next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release t=
he fund unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the =
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and laws, but unfortunate=
ly we learnt that all his supposed next of kin died alongside with him at=
 the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.
And our banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money rema=
ins unclaimed after five years, such money will be moved into the banking=
 treasurer as unclaimed fund. 
 
The request of a foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned =
by the fact that the deceased customer was a foreigner a citizen  Burkina=
 Faso cannot stand as next of kin.
If you accept my proposal to do this deal to the end i will give to you 3=
0% of the total money will be for you as a foreign partner while 10% will=
 be set aside to cover any expenses that might be incurred during the pro=
cess of transferring the fund to your nominated bank account. 
 
If you're willing to handle this deal with me kind get back to me with yo=
ur Private telephone and fax numbers for easy communications well as your=
 personal picture or a copy of your international passport to enable me k=
now whom I=92m dealing with. 
 
Note: I demand the highest trust from you to keep this business strictly =
confidential for security reasons as you may know that the bank don't kno=
w that i am the one that contacted you to stand for this claim.
At the end of this transaction which will be when the money will hit your=
 account safely i will then come over to your country for sharing the fun=
d according to the previous agreed percentage, you might even have to adv=
ice me on possibilities of investment in your country.

I am expecting  your urgent reply so that i will send to you an  applicat=
ion form which you will fill and send  directly to the bank.
Best regards, 
Mr Henry Kabore
