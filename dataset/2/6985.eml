Dear friend 
This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the
fact that we have not yet met=2E I have to say that I
have no intentions of causing you any pains=2E As you
read this=2C I do not want you to feel sorry for me=2C
because=2C I believe everyone will die someday=2E My name
is Mark Daniels=2C a merchant in Dubai=2C in the U=2EA=2EE=2E I
have been diagnosed with prostate and esophageal
cancer that was discovered very late due to my laxity
in caring for my health=2E It has defied all forms of
medicine and right now=2C I have only about a few months
to live according to medical experts=2E
I have not particularly lived my life so well=2C as I
never really cared for anyone not even myself but my
business=2E Though I am very rich=2C I was never generous=2C
I was always hostile to people and only focus on my
business as that was the only thing I cared for=2E But
now I regret all this as I now know that there is more
to life than just wanting to have or make all the
money in the world=2E I believe when God gives me a
second chance to come to this world I would live my
life a different way from how I have lived it=2E Now
that I know my time is near=2C I have willed and given
most of my properties and assets to my immediate and
extended family members and as well as a few close
friends=2E
I have decided to give alms to charity organizations=2C
as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do
on earth=2E So far=2C I have distributed money to some
charity organizations in the U=2EA=2EE=2C London and
Ireland=2E Now that my health has deteriorated so badly=2C
I cannot do this my self any more=2E I once asked
members of my family to close one of my accounts and
donate the money=2C which I have there to charity
organization in Bulgaria=2C they refused and kept the
money to themselves=2E Hence=2C I do not trust them
anymore=2C as they seem not to be contented with what I
have left for them=2E The last of my money which is the
huge cash deposit that I have with security firm
Abroad =2EI will want you to help me collect this
deposit and dispatched it to charity organizations and
let them know that it is I Mark Daniels that is making
this generous donation=2E I am writing this from my
laptop computer in my hospital bed where I wait for my
time to come=2E I pray that God uses you to support and
assist me with good heart=2E
Contact email=3Am=5Fdaniel=40myway=2Ecom
God be with you=2C
Mark Daniels=2E
