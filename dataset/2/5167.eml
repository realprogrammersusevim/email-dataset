o.com

ATTN PLEASE:


I want to transfer to overseas ($15,000.000.00USD) fifteen million United=
 States Dollars) from INTERNATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK OF GHANA, I.am seekin=
g a reliable and honest person who will be capable and fit.

=20

To provide either an existing bank account or set up a new Bank account i=
mmediately to receive this fund, even an empty account can serve this pur=
pose, or you help to seek an honest and. reliable businessman who can ass=
ist us.

=20

I am HON.EDWARD TAYLOR an accountant and bank manager, during the course =
of our auditing I discovered a floating fund.in.a domiciliary account ope=
ned in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this accoun=
t,after going through some old files in the records I discovered that the=
 owner of the account who is a foreigner died without any traceable next =
of Kin hence the dormant nature of the account and if I do not remit this=
 money out urgently it will be re-channeled into the bank=EF=BF=BD reserv=
e.

=20

I suggest we start the first transfer with five million Dollars [$5,000.0=
00] and upon the successful transfer of the first $5 million without hitc=
hes or disappointment from you, I shall re-apply for the remittance of th=
e balance of the fund to your nominated account.


I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money cannot be appr=
oved for a local account here and I am not supposed to be in possession o=
f such amount of dollars, but the fund can only be approved to any foreig=
ner or into a foreign account.

=20

I suggest we meet face to face to get acquainted, as the fund in question=
 is a large one before we commence with transfer i need your full co-oper=
ation to make this work fine, as I will use my office to see that the tra=
nsaction is hitch free and i will destroy all documents relating to the t=
ransaction once we conclude the transaction On the conclusion of this bus=
iness, you will be Given 15% of the Total amount, 80% will be for me, whi=
le 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during the pr=
ocess of this Transaction.


So reply me back to my alternative private mail box: honedwardtaylor1@yah=
oo.com
