Greetings, 
   I am Dr. Phil Hodkinson, Group Finance 
Director (H.B.O.S) I understand that through Internet is not the best 
way to link up with you because of the confidentiality which the 
transaction demands. However, I have already sent you this same letter 
by post one month ago, but I am not sure if it did get to you since I 
have not heard from you, hence my resending it again. 
   I discovered 
a dormant account in my office, as Group finance director with Halifax 
Bank of Scotland. It will be in my interest to transfer this fund worth 
15,000,000 million pounds in an account offshore. If you can be a 
collaborator to this please indicate interest immediately for us to 
proceed. Your contact phone numbers  will be necessary for this 
effect. 
Regards and respect,
Dr. Phil Hodkinson
Group Finance Director
Halifax Bank of Scotland
