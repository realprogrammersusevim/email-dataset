9th floor,

street,
Manchester, M2 1HW.
North of England, UK.

For your kind 
attention, 

Transfer of fund/Investment cum joint venture 

I 
discovered a dormant account in my office, as the Director of 
Integrated Finance. It will be in my interest to transfer this fund 
worth 15,000,000 million pounds in an account offshore. If you can be a 
collaborator to this please indicate interest immediately for us to 
proceed. 

Urgently, i want you to get back to me, to further explain 
all procedures required to move forward with this transaction. I also 
will bring to your notice that the owner of this dormant account was 
Late Engineer John Hughes, a foreigner who died in 1995. Since my 
inception into office in 2001, nobody has operated on this account and 
nobody knows about it or anything concerning it neither does his 
company, a petrol chemical service company here.

I will want you to be 
a beneficiary to this account as the next of kin bearing in mind that 
you are a foreigner with all necessary documents in place as proof.

Do 
respond as soon as possible for details and directions to my new; 
gillespie_mike@myway.com

Regards and respect, 

Mike Gillespie.

Director of Integrated Finance 
Bank of Scotland.
