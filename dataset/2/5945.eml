act(Contract No: FMA/PED/1473/96). This contract was awarded in July,19=
96 and completed in August, 1998, and the original contractor has since=

wenty Five Million, Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars) This a=
mount have been left floating in our account with the federation bank, =
until our recent discovery.

My coleagues and I have decided to seek for the assistance of a reliabl=
e foreign partner into whose account the fund will be transferred into =
for our own use. If this proposal is acceptable to you, a =E2=80=9CDeed=

alf from my office to the federal ministry of finance (FMF) and the fed=
eration bank for the subsequent release and transfer of the fund into y=
our nominated account.Be informed that we are working in collaboration =
with top officials of the federal ministry of finance and the federatio=
n bank, who will assist us in the transfer of the fund. With your coope=
ration the success of this transaction is guaranteed.

We have agreed to compensate you with 25% of the total sum, 70% will be=
 for me and my colleagues here, while the remaining 5% have been mapped=
-out for miscellaneous expenses that might be incurred by both parties =
during the course of this transaction. All things being equal, this tra=
nsaction will be concluded within 6 working days upon the day of receip=
t of your response. You are required to email us your nominated bank ac=
count details and your direct telephone and fax numbers. Please treat t=
his transaction with top priority and remember to keep it as confidenti=
al as possible.
