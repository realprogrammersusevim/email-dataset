Attn...

I am  Barrister Antwan Saloum contacting you today for a business  which
would be of immense benefit to you.I am an attorney at law.I have  a practice
in Nigeria. I am the personal attorney to Mrs. Stella  Obasanjo the first
lady and wife to the president of the Federal  Republic Of Nigeria.

Unfortunately, Mrs. Stella Obasanjo died in  Spain on the 23th of October
2005 while undergoing medical treatment.

I wish to  invest the sum of $135 million overseas(One huned and thirty five
million US Dollars). The beneficiary is her only son who is still very young
to handle this fund at this time,however because the president  has so many
wives and the first lady been the last but rather  fortunate, the others
are looking for a way to deprive this boy of what  heas mother has work for
all this years,This boy needs your help.

Your fees as fund manager shall be 30% of the investment capital and an annual
20% of after tax returns on investment.if you are interested in  this proposal
let me know so that I will give you relevant details

Best Regards

Barrister:Antwan  Saloum
