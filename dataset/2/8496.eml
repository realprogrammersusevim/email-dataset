Hello My Dear Beloved Friend,
 
My name is Mrs. Martha Pujeh; I am a dying woman who had decided to 
Donate what I have to you. You may be wondering why I choose you. But 
Someone has to be chosen. I am 59 years old and was diagnosed for cancer =
About 2 years ago, immediately after the death of my husband, who had Left me =
everything he worked for.

I have been touched by God to donate from what I have inherited from my late =
husband to you for the good work of God, rather than allow my relatives to =
use my husband's hard earned funds ungodly. I have asked God to forgive me =
all my sins and I believe he has, because He is a merciful God. I will be =
going in for an Operation and I pray that I survive the operation.

I have decided to WILL/Donate the sum of (US$12,000,000.00 (Twelve Million =
United State Dollars) to you for the good work of the lord, and to help the =
motherless, less privileged and also for the assistance of the Widows. At the =
moment I cannot take any telephone calls, due to the fact That my relatives =
are around me and I have been restricted by my doctor from taking telephone =
calls because I deserve all the rest I can get.Presently,

I have informed my lawyer about my decision in WILLING this 
Fund to you. I wish you all the best and may the good Lord bless you =
abundantly, and please use the funds well and always extend the good work to =
others.Kindly Contact my lawyer through this email address =
(barr_williamlegrojr@excite.com) if you are interested in carrying 
Out this task, so that he can arrange the release of the funds to you. 

My lawyer's name is Barrister William Legro Richard Junior. 
I know I have never met you but my mind tells me to do this, and I hope 
You act sincerely. I will pay you %10 of this money if you will assist me =
because I am now too weak and fragile to do things myself because of my =
cancer.

NB: I will appreciate your utmost confidentiality in this matter until 
The task is accomplished, as I don't want anything that will jeopardize 
My last wish, due to the fact that I do not want relatives or family 
Members standing in the way of my last wish.

Please I need your immediately response, 
 
Love,

Mrs. Martha Pujeh.
