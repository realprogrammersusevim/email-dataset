My Dear Friend,
 
I am Mr.George Akin,from Arab Bank Plc,Benin Rep. During the 
course of our auditing we discovered the sum of (USD$9.7m) 
floating in an account opened in this Bank since 1999 and as 
from 2001 nobody has operated on this account again, and after 
going through some old files in the records I discovered that 
the owner of the account died without a [HEIRE]sept 11th 2001 
by plane crash, hence the money is floating.

After due verification I noticed that no other person knows 
about this account except his wife who was also invovled in the 
crash, and the account has no other beneficiary and my 
investigation proved to me as well that until his death he was 
the Director GOLD ARK [SARL]
 
Since our Bank Arab Bank Plc Benin rep. got information about 
his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come 
forward and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines and policies 
but up to date nobody came up to this bank as his next of kin 
or relative. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and 
other officials in my department now decided to make this 
businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the 
next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and 
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming forth and we 
don't want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed 
Bill.
 
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used 
as the next of kin as no one has come up as his relation. And 
the country law here does not allow such money to stay more 
than Five years, for the money will be recalled to the 
government treasury as unclaimed after this period.
Upon the receipt of your response, I will send to you the 
application form, bank's contact and the next step to take. I 
will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is 
hitch free and that you should not entertain any fear as all 
modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five 
banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the 
deceased.
 
When you receive this letter, kindly send me an e-mail 
signifying your decision.Including your private Tel/Fax numbers 
for quick communication. I will be very happy if you can treat 
this business with the utmost secrecy it demands because of my 
position in this bank.

Hoping for a very successful business relationship with you.
Respectfully submitted,

Mr George Akin.
