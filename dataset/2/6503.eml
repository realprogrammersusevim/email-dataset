Dearest In Christ, 

It is with Heavy Heart i am reaching you regarding the death of my 
late client. I am Barrister Robert Beaud, the legal adviser to late 
MR. MIKE  & CAROL HALL, a very Wealthy Couple that lived here in the 
United Kingdom, before their recent Death on the 26th of December 
during the Tsunami disaster last year 
(2004).http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/bristol/4153821.stm) these 
couple served God as very dedicated Christians,they so dedicated their 
life to God but they had no child till they died. They acquired a lot 
of landed properties like lands, Stocks/Bond,house properties, etc. As 
their legal adviser, before their death, the husband Mr. Mike  & Carol 
Hall instructed me to write his WILL because they had no child, they 
dedicated their wealth to God. 

According to the WILL, their assets should be given out to a ministry 
for the work of God. As their legal adviser, all the documents for the 
assets that are deposited with the security company are in my care. He 
gave me the authority to give out the funds to the Ministries for the 
work of God. As instructed by  MR. MIKE HALL before his death. As a 
matter of fact the total amount of money that is contained in the two 
trunk Boxes is $10,000,000.00 ,They did not want the management of the 
Security Company to know the content of the consignments, therefore 
they registered the content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the 
security company believes that what They deposited with them were Gold 
Bars. 

As a born again Christian,I have been reading my bible and I have to 
do what is lawful and right in the sight of God by giving out the fund 
to the chosen ministry for the purpose of God's work as instructed by 
the owner before his death.After my fasting and prayers Today, I asked 
God to make his choice and direct me to an honest Christian or the 
chosen ministry that deserves this fund by his Grace. I then came 
across your address on the Internet as I was browsing through a 
Christian site.I appeal to you for the fund to be used wisely for 
things that will glorify the name of God. I have just notified the 
Security Company where they deposited the consignments that contained 
the fund, that I am moving the consignment abroad, and the security 
company is awaiting my authority to move the consignment out of the 
shores of my country. 

Dear child of zion, if you know that you will use this fund honestly 
and wisely for things that will glorify God's name, then do contact me 
with the above mentioned information via (rbeaud14@netscape.net) 
Your prompt response will be highly appreciated. 

Yours in Christ. 

Barrister Robert Beaud.
