DEAR PARTNER,

RE:TRANSFER OF USD168,559,000.00 MILLION TO YOUR
ACCOUNT. 

I feel quite safe dealing with you in this important
business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been
greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it
because it still remains the fastest medium of
communication. However, this correspondence is
private, and it should be treated in strict
confidence.

At first I will like to assure you that this
transaction is 100% risk and trouble free to both
parties.

In order to transfer out USD168,559,000.00{ One
hundred and sixty eight million five hundred and fifty
nine thousand U.S dollar Only } from our bank here in
South Africa. The fund for transfer is of clean
origin. The owner of the fund is a foreigner, a 
program leader who was believed to acquire the fund
through his secret Crude Oil deal with the Former
IRAQI government.The deceased died with all the
members of his family in an auto-accident in June 23,
1999 without a WILL. The amount involved is USD168,559,000.00

I want to transfer this money into your account as the
foreign beneficiary of the fund. I know that this
letter will come to you as a surprise as we don't know
ourselves before, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL AND A
GENUINE BUSINESS. I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU
WILL NOT LET ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR
ACCOUNT. 

Let me hear from you. 

Regards,
GREGG CESAR
