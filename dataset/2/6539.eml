We were married for eleven years without a child. My late husband was killed by the rebels in  Bouake the formaer Capital of Cote D'Ivoire during the recent political Crisis of 19th september 2002. When my late husband was alive we deposited the sum of$1.5Million (One Million five hundred thousand U.S. Dollars) in a BANK here in COTE D'IVOIRE for investment aboard.

   
  Presently, this money is still with the bank.resently my Doctor told me that I would not last due to cancer problem. Having known my condition I decided to look for some one aboard who will help me receive and invest this money in a profitable business for the benefit of my adopted chiled because this the only hope of this my adopted child now because the relation of my husband did not know about this money.They have seized all my husband belongings and told me to go because i did not have a child for them.Again I
will like to come to your country as soon as this money is transferred to your account so that i will be able to treat myself because they have told me that there are better doctors aboard who be able to cure this my sickness.Please if you have accepted to help me i will like to hear from you as soon as possible
and i promise to conpenset you with 15%  of this money for helping me.
   
  I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and the presence of my husband family and relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development.
