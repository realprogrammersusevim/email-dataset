MR.FAN JEN-LIANG.
SHANGHAI COMMERCIAL BANK LIMITED,UK BRANCH
65 CORNHILL LONDON EC3V 3NP,UNITED KINGDOM.

Greetings,

I would not have used this medium (Internet) but I choose to reach you
through it because it is the fastest,surest and most secured medium of
communication. However,this correspondence is un-official and private,and
it should be treated as such. I also guarantee you that this transaction
is risk free from all what you may think of.

I am Mr.Fan Jen-Liang,an account officer with SHANGHAI COMMERCIAL BANK
LIMITED (London Branch), I am contacting you based on trust and
confidentiality that will be attached to this transaction.The Management
and the Legal department of our BANK (SHANGHAI COMMERCIAL BANK LIMITED UK)
in a recent meeting,recommended that the account of one of my late
customer and branch depositor MR. YUGUANG ZHENG,should be declared
dormant,confisticated and the depositor's fund sent to the Bank Treasury
according to UK Banking and financial law.
The depositor,YUGUANG ZHENG died in world trade centre and was one of the
victims of the september 11,2001 incident that befall the United State of
America,ever since his death the bank has made series of efforts to
contact any of the relatives to claim this money but without success, you
can confirm through this site:
http://www.september11victims.com/september11Victims/victims_list.htm

MR.YUGUANG ZHENG is an account holder in my branch, he owns a dollar
account with the sum of US$8.3M (Eight Million,three Hundred Thousand
United States Dollars Only) deposited in a Secret account with my branch
.In fact, since his death in 2001, no next of kin of the Dollar account
holder nor any his relative  has shown up to claim his money this is
because he has the account as a secret account and he left all the
documents for the deposit with me.

Having waited since 2001,I am now fully convinced that no one would turn
up to claim his money before the bank stipulated collection deadline and
this is where I am interested and why I want to present you now to my bank
as the relation of the deceased,I will use my position here in the bank
and I will give you the relevant documents and contacts to file in the
claim application and then effect the approvals for  the transfer of the
money to your nominated bank account, I will be the one to provide the
vital documents for the claims of the money and then advise you  exactly
how we should handle it.

Please include your telephone/fax number/ Home Address when replying this
mail and I will give you more information as soon as you indicate your
willingness to assist in this transaction.
I will use my position to get all internal documentations to back up the
claims.Do not be bothered that you are not related in any way to him as I
am in position to afix your name as the next of kin.
The whole Procedures will last only 7 working days to get the fund
retrieved successfully without trace even in future. After the transfer of
the money we shall share the money 60-40,that is I  will have 60% while
you will have 40%.
I await your urgent response to this mail.Reply to my Private Email:
fanjenliang@terrapins.com or call me on my direct telephone:
44-7031915718.

Remain blessed,

MR.FAN JEN-LIANG.
