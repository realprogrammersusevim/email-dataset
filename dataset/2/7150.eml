Million eight hundred United State Dollars=29=2C =28this is aside the accrued
interest so far from that date=29 the bank now expects his next of kin 
as beneficiary=2E Valuable efforts are being made by the Bank to get in 
touch with any of the Claude's Family or Relatives but to no success=2E
Since we got information about his death=2C we have been expecting his 
next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release 
it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we 
learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside 
with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim=2E
 
It is because of the perceived possibility of not being able to locate 
any of Late Engr=2E Peter Claude =28Snr=2E=29's next of kin =2E The Management 
under the influence of our Chairman and Members of the Board of 
Directors=2C Thus that arrangement will be made for the fund to be decleared 
=22Unclaimed=22 and subsequentlly be donated to the trust fund for arms and
ammunition to further enhance the course of War in Africa and the World

kin to the late Engr=2Epeter Claude  =28Snr=2E=29 so that the fund will be 
released and paid into your Account as the beneficiary=2Fnext of kin=2E  
The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned
by the fact that the customer=28Claude=29 was a foreigner and a Local person here 
in the country  cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner=2E


All documents and proves to enable you get this fund will be carefully 
worked out=2E We have secured from the probate registry=2C an order of 
Mandamus to locate any of the deceased's beneficiary=28ies=29=2C and more so
