PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USED IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD.
I am the above named person from Kuwait. I am married to Dr.Harry Jones who =
worked with Kuwait embassy in Ivory Coast for nine yearsbefore he died in the =
year 2000.We were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a =
brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both =
born again Christians.Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a =
child outside my  matrimonial home which the Bible is against.When my
late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$8.6Million (Eight Millionsix =
hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars) with one finance/security company in =
Amsterderm Holland. Presently, this money is still with the Security Company. =
Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next
three months due to cancer problem. Though what disturbs me most is my  =
stroke sickness. Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to =
church or better still a christian individual that will utilize this money =
the way I am going to instruct here in. I want a church that will
use this fund to fund churches, orphanages and widows propagating the word of =
God and to ensure  that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to =
understand that Blessed is the hand that giveth.
I took this decision because I don't have any child that will  inherit this =
money and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my =
husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don'twant a =
situation where this money will be used in an ungodly manner.
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. I am not afraid of death =
hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of =
the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that  the lord will fight my case and I shall =
hold my peace. I don't need any telephone communication in this
regard because of my health because of the presence of my husband's relatives =
around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. 
With God all things are possible.  As soon as I receiveyour reply I shall =
give you the contact of the Finance/Security Company in Amsterderm Holland. I =
will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the =
original- beneficiary of this fund. I want you and the church to always pray =
for me because the lord is my shephard. My 
happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to =
serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful =
all through your life. Any delay  in your reply will give me room in sourcing =
for a chuch or christian individual for this
same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I stated =
herein.  Hoping to hearing from you. N.B-PLEASE I WILL ADVICE YOU TO GIVE THE =
LAWYER IN CHARGE A CALL IN HOLLAND IMMEDIATELY, HE DOES EVERYTHING ON MY =
BEHALF AND HE'S VERY UNDERSTANDING AND I BELIEVE HE WILL LEAD YOU TO YOUR =
SUCCESS IN JESUS
