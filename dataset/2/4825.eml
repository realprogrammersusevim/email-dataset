Greetings from Dubai,
 
This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a =
day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.  I am =
Mr. Ali Raza Khan, currently Head of Coporate affairs with a reputable bank =
here in U. A. E.  I write you this proposal in good faith, believing that I =
can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to you.
 
I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =
November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign  Oil consultant/contractor with the =
CHEVRON PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. jack farrer powell  made a (Fixed deposit) =
for 36 calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five =
hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my 
bank and I happen to be his account officer before I was moved to my present =
position recently. Upon maturity in 2003,as his account officer and as well =
the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a =
routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was returned =
undelivered. 
 
After sometime, I tried sending back the letter,but it was again returned and =
finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum =
Corporation that Mr.jack farrer powell  died as a result of torture in the =
hand of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to =
his country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. =
On further investigation, I discovered that Mr. jack farrer powell  family =
wife and two sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he =
did not declare any next of kin or relation in all his 
official documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did =
not leave any WILL.This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed =
under dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have =
heard from the owner since 2003.I wish to let you know that all the =
investigation I have made so far, my bank 
management is not aware of it, I am the only one that have the information.
 
With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =
support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E.  By =
end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which =
will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above =
$5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for =
terrorism support.  If I do not move this money out of the country =
immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =
money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source =
of the money.  
 
I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner and =
that is why I am contacting you for an assistance.  As the Account Officer to =
late jack farrer powell , coupled with my present position and status in the =
bank as Head of Retail Banking Groug , I have the power to influence the =
release of the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the =
account, with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall =
give you.  All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully =
worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be =
executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and =
anything goes.
 
If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share =
the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are =
interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message  so we can go over =
the details.  
Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat with utmost =
confidentiality . I shall send you copy of his last statement of account =
issued to Al Nasser when the deposit was made for your perusal.  I wait your =
urgent response soon. 
  
 
Regards,     
Mr. Ali Raza Khan.
