REPLY TO EMAIL ADDRESS: awilliams44@k.ro
Dear Friend,
SEEKING YOUR IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE.
Please Permit me to make your acquaintance in so informal a manner. This is 
necessitated by my urgent need to reach a dependable and trust wordy foreign
partner. This request may seem strange and unsolicited but I will crave your 
indulgence and pray that you view it seriously. My name is MR Ademola Williams 
of the Democratic Republic of Congo and One of the close aides to the former 
President of the Democratic Republic of Congo LAURENT KABILA of blessed memory, 
may his soul rest in peace.
Due to the military campaign of LAURENT KABILA to force out the rebels in my 
country, I and some of my colleagues were instructed by Late President Kabila
to  go abroad to purchase arms and ammunition worth of Twenty Million, Five 
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars only (US$20,500,000.00) to fight the 
rebel group. But when President Kabila was killed in a bloody shoot-out by one 
of his aide a day before we were schedule to travel out of Congo, We 
immediately decided to divert the fund into a private security company here in 
Congo for safe keeping. The security of the said amount is presently being 
threatened here following the arrest and seizure of properties of Col. Rasheidi 
Karesava (One of the aides to Laurent Kabila) a tribesman, and some other 
Military Personnel from our same tribe, by the new President of the Democratic 
Republic of Congo, the son of late President Laurent Kabila, Joseph Kabila.In 
view of this, we need a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who can assist 
us to move this money out of my country as the beneficiary.
WE have sufficient ''CONTACTS'' to move the fund under Diplomatic Cover to a 
security company in the europe in your name. This is to ensure that the 
Diplomatic Baggage is marked ''CONFIDENTIAL'' and it  will not pass through 
normal custom/airport screening and clearance.friends (western countries) who 
suddenly became hostile to those of us who worked with the late President 
Kabila, immediately after his son took office. Though we have neither seen nor 
met each other, the information We gathered from an associate who has worked in 
your country has encouraged and convinced us that with your sincere assistance, 
this transaction will be properly handled with modesty and honesty to a huge 
success within two weeks. The said money is a state fund and therefore requires 
a total confidentiality.Thus, if you are willing to assist us move this fund 
out of Congo, you can contact me through my email address above with your 
telephone, fax number and personal information to enable us discuss the 
modalities and what will be your share (percentage) for assisting us.
I must use this opportunity and medium to implore You to exercise the utmost 
indulgence to keep this Matter extraordinarily confidential, Whatever your 
Decision, while I await your prompt response. Thank you and GodBless.

Best Regards

MR WILLIAMS .
