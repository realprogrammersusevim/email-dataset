Dear friend,
this mail will definitely be coming to you as a surprise, but i must crave
your indulgence to
introduce myself to you.
   I am Miss Marah sadija, former mistress to the son (Qusay) of the Iraqi
former leader, Saddam
Hussein.  I am an Ethiopian, by birth and i am presently in a refugee camp
in Zimbabwe, where
the living conditions are unbearable.   I do not wish to tak
e your time with a lenghty mail, but i have to put this proposal to you so
that you can assist me.
        While i was still in contact with Qusay,he made a deposit in my
name to a security firm in
Spain, which has an affiliate branch in Amsterdam.
This deposit was made in my name and the secret code and necessary
documents are presently in
the possession of an attorney, presently in Spain.
   This deposit was made in the form of a consigment and the content is a
considerable amount of
money in United state dollars which i cannot disclose to you for security
purposes, until you have
confirmed your willingness to assist me.
 I would be pleased and grateful to you if you could assist me in
collecting this consignment on my
behalf from the security firm in Spain, upon which i will be offering you a
percentage for your
efforts.
  The attorney in Spain, will arrange an authority to release and pay in
your name which you will
tender to the security firm coupled with all necessary documents that will
back up your claims in
collecting this consignment on my behalf.
  I have to stop here now as your response will determine our
subsequent corresspondence. Please feel free to dis-regard this proposal if
it is not in line with
your principles.
Allah bless you,
Marah Sadija
