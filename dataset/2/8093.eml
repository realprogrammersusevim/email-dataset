Dear Sir,=0D
=0D
 Let me start by introducing myself. I am Mr. Wang Qin credit officer of =
the Hang Seng Bank Ltd.  I have a concealed business suggestion for you.B=
efore the U.S and Iraqi war our client General. Ibrahim Moussa who was wi=
th the Iraqi forces and also business man made a numbered fixed deposit f=
or 18 calendar months, with a value of Twenty millions Five Hundred Thous=
and United State Dollars only in my branch.Upon maturity several notice w=
as sent to him, even during the war early this year. Again after the war =
 another notification was sent and still no response came from him. We la=
ter find out that the General and his family had been killed during the w=
ar in bomb blast that hit their home.After further investigation it was a=
lso discovered that Gen. Ibrahim Moussa did not declare any next of kin i=
n his official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And h=
e also confided in me the last time he was at my office that no one excep=
t me knew of his deposit in my bank. =0D
 So, Twenty millions Five Hundred Thousand United State Dollars is still =
lying in my bank and no one will ever come forward to claim it. What both=
ers me most is that according to the to the laws of my country at the exp=
iration 4 years and 6months the funds will revert to the ownership of the=
 Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the funds. Against this =
backdrop, my suggestion to you is thatI will like you as a foreigner to s=
tand as the next of kin to Gen.Ibrahim Moussa so that you will be able to=
 receive his funds. =0D

ll come out successful. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare th=
e necessary document that will back you up as the next of kin to Gen. Ibr=
ahim Moussa, all that is required from you at this stage is for you to pr=
ovide me with your Full Names and Address so that the attorney can commen=
ce his job. After you have been made the next of kin, the attorney will a=
lso fill in for claims on your behalf and secure the necessary approval a=
nd letter of probate in your favor for the move of the funds to an accoun=
t that will be provided by you.There is no risk involved at all in the ma=
tter as weare going adopt a legalized method and the attorney will prepar=
e all the necessary documents. Please endeavor to observe utmost discreti=
on in all matters concerning this issue.=0D

s incurred during the course of this operation. Should you be interested =
