Greeting in the name of our lord Jesus Christ.
I am Mrs. Catherine Charles, a widow to late sheik Charles. I am 61 years 
Old, i am now a new Christian convert, suffering from long time cancer of 
the breast, from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating It is 
quite obvious that I won't live more than six months, according to my 
doctors, this is because the cancer stage has gotten to a very stage.My late 
husband was killed during the U.S. raid against terrorism in Afghanistan,and 
during the period of our marriage we couldnt produce any child.my late 
husband was very wealthy and after his death,I inherited all his business 
and wealth. The doctors has advised me that I may not live for More than six 
months, so I now decided to divide the part of this wealth, to contribute to 
the development of the church in Africa, America Asia, and Europe. i prayed 
over it,. I am willing to donate the sum of $5,000.000.00 us dollars, to the 
less prvileged. Please I want you to note that Fundis lying in the central 
Bank of Nigeria and upon my instruction, my attorney presently is in Africa 
distributing relief materials to of bombast in slerra-leone, he will file in 
an application for the transfer of the money in your name.lastly, I honestly 
pray that this money when transferred will be sure for the said purpose, 
because I have come to find out that wealth acquisition without Christ is 
vanity. May the grace of our lord Jesus the love of god and the fellowship 
of God be with you and your family i await urgent reply.

  yours in Christ.
  Mrs. Catherine Charles
