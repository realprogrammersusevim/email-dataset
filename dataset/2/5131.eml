DEAR:SIR/MADAM

I am Mr Joel Taylor I work with the office of the Director, Foreign 
Operation Department of Eco Bank NIG. PLC, Lagos Branch. It happened On the 
2nd of May 1999, Engr. S. BARNHILL, an AMERICAN  from New Orleans who used 
to work with Shell Petroleum Development Company In Nigeria (SPDC), Mr Engr. 
S. BARNHILL, his wife And their three children were involved in a car 
accident along Shagamu Express Road. All occupants of the vehicle 
unfortunately lost their lives. Since then, Eco Bank NIG. PLC have made 
several enquiries to  embassies to locate any of the extended relatives, 
this has also proved unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to trace his relatives 
over the Internet, to locate any member of his family but of no avail, hence 
I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money 
that belong to Mr Engr. S. BARNHILL, before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were lodged. 
Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at about 
$18.6 Million Dollars has issued a notice to provide the next of kin or have 
the account confiscated within the next ten official working days.

Since bank have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3 years 
now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased, 
so that the proceeds of this account valued at $18.6 Million Dollars can be 
paid to you and then you and me can share the money,50% to me and 45% to 
you, while 5% should be for expenses or tax as your government may require, 
I have the Certificate of deposit that can be used to back up any claim we 
may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this 
deal through.

I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with me by 
my email to enable us discuss further.
Thank you

My Regards,

Joel Taylor
