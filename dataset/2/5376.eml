Hello dear,
I am Mr. Chiwetalu Philips Onuma, an accountant officer 
with Intercontinental Bank,Plc (I.B.P) branch here in Dakar Senegal. 
dear I gathered your information from my country's international 
chamber commerce and industries, The business I am about to introduce 
is based-on sheer trust and with a sense of purpose. I am contacting 
you to assist in repatriating the sum of eighteen million two hundred 
thousand united state dollars. 

The money and property left behind by 
(James Groover D.) an American Chair Merchant here in my country who 
died accidentally On the 21st of April 2004. Sir, I gathered all this 
information through a good source after my several routine note to his 
forwarding address because he had served here in Dakar Senegal as a 
business consultant with the Senegalese National Petroleum & Gas 
Cooperation.S.N.P.G.C and a legal adviser to the O.P.E.C Chairman.

Since then I have made several inquiries to American embassy here in 
Dakar Senegal to locate any of his extended relatives or family, this 
has also proved unsuccessful to locate any member of his family hence I 
contacted you. I am his account officer and I contact you to work
with 
you before the fund get confiscate or declared unserviced by the bank 
management and board of my directors because the management of my bank 
has been deliberating on how to revert this fund to the bank privacy 
and Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over 3 
years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the 
deceased since you are a foreigner so that the proceeds of this account 
valued at eighteen million two hundred thousand united state dollars 
can be paid to you and then you and I will share the money fifty 
percent to me and forty percent to you, while ten percent will be 
mapped out for any miscellaneous expenses that might incur in the cause 
of this transaction.

Note, I have all the necessary legal documents to 
back up this claim, and this I must do to make sure that this fund is 
not wasted or end up in the wrong hands. All I require is your honest 
and sincere co-operation to enable us see this ordeal and claim 
through, again I
guarantee you that this transaction will be executed 
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you and I from any 
breach of the law. 

Reply me through my private e-mail addres;
(chiwetalu_onuma10@voila.fr) for further explanations before proceed 
and as soon as I hear from you, A VERY GOOD EVIDENCE WILL BE GIVING TO 
YOU FOR CONFIRMATIONS.Trusting to hearing from you.

Yours Sincerely,
Mr.Chiwetalu P. Onuma.
