finally we discovered from his contract employers=2C the South Africa Mining
Corporation that Mr=2ERichard Moss died from an automobile accident=2E On
further investigation=2C I found out that he died without making a WILL=2C and
all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless=2E

including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank=2E This sum of
US$25=2C000=2C000=2E00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year=2E No one will
ever come forward to claim it=2E According to South Africa Law=2C at the
expiration of 5 =28five=29 years=2C the money will revert to the ownership of the
South Africa Government if nobody applies to claim the fund=2E

in as the next of kin to Mr=2E Richard Moss so that the fruits of this old
man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government
officials=2E This is simple=2C I will like you to provide immediately your full
names and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin=2E We shall
employ the service of two Attorneys for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of
probate=2Fadministration in your favor for the transfer=2E A bank account in
any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the
transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary=2Fnext of kin=2E The money
will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me
and 40% for you=2E
 There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be
done by the Attorney and my position as the Finance Director guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction=2E If you are interested=2C please
reply immediately via the private email address below=2E Upon your response=2C
