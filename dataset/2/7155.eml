31 Eugene Marais Avenue,

South Africa. 

                                                      
              (URGENT BUSINESS) 

My name is Dr.steven kech. and I work in the
International operation department in a Local Bank
here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I
discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL.
Of 36,000,000 (Thirty Six Million USD) on further
discreet investigation, I also discovered that the
account holder has long since passed away (dead)
leaving no beneficiary to the account. 

The bank will approve this money to any foreigner
because the former operator of the a/c is a foreigner
and from Iraq in particular and I am certainly sure
that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the
claim of this money A foreigner can only claim this
money with legal claims to the account Holder;
therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction.


I will provide the necessary information needed in
order to claim this money, But you will need to open
an account where this can be transferred. If
interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax
number including full details of the account to be
used for the Deposit I wish for utmost confidentiality
in handling this transaction as my job and the future
of my family would be jeopardized if it were breached.


I want to assure you that the transaction is without
risk if due process is followed accordingly. Finally I
will give you 25% for your corporation. 

I look forward to a favorable response from you  

Yours, 

Dr.steven kech.
