Attn;Sir,

        REQUEST FOR URGENT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
After due deliberation with my colleagues, I decided to forward this prop=
osal.
We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum of Thir=
ty
Million United States Dollars (US$30,000,000.00) into his/her account.Thi=
s
fund resulted from an over-invoced bill from contract awarded by us under=

the budget allocation to my ministry and the bill was approved for paymen=
t
by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed, commissioned=

and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract. we are left
with the balance of US$30,000,000.00 as part of the over-invoiced amount,=

which we have deliberately over estimated, for our own 

I am contacting you to be our custodian for this fund.

1. 20% for you (Account Owner)
2. 70% for us
3. 10% for Tax, as may required by our Government and yours.

om
a foreign establishment like yours. With this invoice, we will seek appro=
val
to transfer the fund within 14 banking days through the APEX BANK to your=

designatd Bank Account.

I and one of my colleague involved in this deal will come to your country=

to arrange for our share upon the confirmation from you that the money ha=
s
been credited into your nominated Bank Account. Consequently upon your ac=
ceptance
of my proposal,kindly confirm your interest by revert mail to the above
e/mail address It will surprise you why we choose you and trusted you for=

this transaction. Yes, we believe that good friends can be discovered and=

business like this cannot be realized without trust. This is why we have
decided to trust you for this transaction. we are looking forward to doin=
g
this transaction with you.

Be further informed that everyone's interest and security had been consid=
ered
before you were
contacted. So be rest assured and feel free to go into this transaction
with us. But let honesty be our watch word throughout this transaction an=
d
