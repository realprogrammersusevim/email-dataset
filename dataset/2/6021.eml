osal.
We want a reliable person who could assist us to transfer the sum of Thir=
ty
Million United States Dollars (US$30,000,000.00) into his/her account.Thi=
s
fund resulted from an over-invoced bill from contract awarded by us under=

the budget allocation to my ministry and the bill was approved for paymen=
t
by the concerned ministries. The contract has been executed, commissioned=

and the contractor was paid the actual cost of the contract. we are left
with the balance of US$30,000,000.00 as part of the over-invoiced amount,=

which we have deliberately over estimated, for our own 

I am contacting you to be our custodian for this fund.

I and one of my colleague involved in this deal will come to your country=

to arrange for our share upon the confirmation from you that the money ha=
s
been credited into your nominated Bank Account. Consequently upon your ac=
ceptance

business like this cannot be realized without trust. This is why we have

ered
before you were
