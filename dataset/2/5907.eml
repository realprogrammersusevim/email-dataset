Dearest In Christ,

I am Mrs Elizabeth Williams,from Kuwait.I am married to late Mr Jerry Wil=
liams,
who worked with Kuwait Embassy in Ivory Coast for Twenty-Six years before=

he died in the year 2001,after a brief illness that lasted for only five
days.  We were married for Eighteen years with a duaghter(Lilian)who late=
r
died in a motor accident.

Before the untimely death of my husband,we were both born again Christian=
s.
Since after his death I decided not to remarry or get a child outside my
matrimonial home which the Bible is against. When my late husband was ali=
ve
he deposited the sum of (US$5.8 M)(Five Million,Eight hundred Thousand Un=
ited
States Dollar) in a General Trust Account with a prime bank in Abidjan Co=
te
d'Ivoire. Presently,this money is still with the bank. 

Recently,Following my ill health, my Doctor told me that I may not last f=
or
the next eight months due to my cancer problem.The one that disturbs me m=
ost
is my stroke sickness.Having known my condition I decided to donate this
fund to a Christain organization (Church) that will utilize this money th=
e
way I am going to instruct herein,according to the desire of my late husb=
and
before his death.

I want this fund to be used in Christain Activities like,Orphanages, Chri=
stain
schools, and Churches for propagating the word of God and to endeavor tha=
t
the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that "Ble=
ssed
is the hand that giveth". I took this decision because I don't have any c=
hild
that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christians
and I don't want my husband's efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't
want a situation where this money will be used in an ungodly way. This is=

why I am taking this decision. I am not afraid of death hence I know wher=
e
I am going. I know that I am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus=

14 VS 14 says that "the lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace=
".
I don't need any telephone communication in this regard because of my hea=
lth
hence the presence of my husband's relatives around me always.I don't wan=
t
them to know about this development.With God all things are possible. 

As soon as I receive your reply I shall give you the contact of the bank
in Abidjan. I will also issue you the documents that will prove you the p=
resent
beneficiary of this fund. 
I want you and the Church to always pray for me because the lord is my sh=
ephard.
My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that W=
ants
to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and Truth. Please always be pr=
ayerful
all through your life. Contact me on this e-mail address:(elizabeth_w1007=
@yahoo.com).
any delay in yourreply will give me room in sourcing another Church for t=
his
same purpose. 

Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I Stated herein. Hoping=

to receive your reply. 

Remain blessed in the Lord. 
Yours in Christ,
