<P><BR><BR><STRONG>BURKINA FASO.<BR>WEST AFRICA.<BR><BR>Dear Friend,<BR><=
BR>I Mr.Sami mohammad&nbsp;the Chairman of&nbsp; Contract Awarding Commit=
tee of&nbsp; the EUROPEAN UNION CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT(ECC)&nbsp; in BURKI=
NA FASO West </STRONG><STRONG>Africa. I got your information in a busines=
s directory from the Burkina Faso Chamber of Commerce and ndustries, when=
 I was searching for a reliable, honest and trust worthy person to entrus=
t this business with. I was simply inspired and <BR></P></STRONG>
<P><STRONG>motivated to pick your contact from the directory. After discu=
ssing my&nbsp; view and your profile with my colleagues, they were very m=
uch satisfied and decided to contact you immediately for this mutual busi=
ness relationship.</STRONG></P><STRONG>
<P><BR>We wish to transfer the sum of USD$36.000,000.00 (Thirty Six milli=
on United </STRONG><STRONG>States Dollars only.) into your personal or co=
mpany's bank account. This fund was a residue of the over invoiced contra=
ct bills awarded by us for the supply of&nbsp; equiment,hard/soft&nbsp; w=
ares, pharmaceuticals/medical items relating to constructing tool's, ligh=
t and heavy duty vehicles, apparels and other administrative logistics et=
c for the Burkina Faso Projects. This DEAL was deliberately hatched out a=
nd </STRONG><STRONG>carefully protected with all the attendant loop holes=
 sealed off. As the Chairman of CAC, I have the cooperation and mandate o=
f the Financial Director and the Secretary of the Organisation. We arrang=
ed and over invoiced the contract funds supplied by different companies f=
rom different countries. It was our consensus to seek the assistance of a=
 willing foreigner to provide us with the facilities to transfer this mon=
ey out of Burkina </STRONG><STRONG>Faso.<
 /STRONG></P><STRONG>
<P><BR>This is borne out of our belief in the non-stable and sporous poli=
tical nature of this sub-egion.The original contractors have been duly pa=
id by the Bank of Africa Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa. (Bank of Afri=
ca, Ouaga-Burkina-Faso in West Africa). Through our bankers - Societe&nbs=
p; Generale <BR>Banque. This balance is suspended in the escrow accounts =
awaiting claims by </STRONG><STRONG>any foreign company of our choice. We=
 intend to pay out this fund NOW as the organization is winding up its ac=
tivities and the coast has been achieved. </STRONG></P>
<P><STRONG><BR>Based on the laws and ethics of employment, we as civil se=
rvants working under this organization, are not allowed to operate a fore=
ign account. This is the more reason why we needed your assistance to pro=
vide an account that can sustain this fund for safe keeping and our futur=
e investment with your comprehensive advise, assistance and partnership i=
n your country.It is however agreed, as the account owner in this deal to=
 allow you 30% of the entire sum as compensation, 60% will be held on tru=
st for us while 10% will be used to defray any incidental charges and cos=
t during the course of the transaction.<BR></P></STRONG>
<P><STRONG>This transaction will be successfully concluded within 14 days=
 if you accord us your unalloyed and due cooperation. You should provide =
the followings;YOUR COMPANY'S NAME WITH COMPLETE ADDRESS,</STRONG><STRONG=
>TEL AND FAX NUMBERS. (if available)THE NAME OF YOUR BANK,ITS ADDRESS WIT=
H TEL, FAX AND TELEX NUMBERS AND YOUR&nbsp; ACCOUNT NUMBER. THE COMPLETE =
MAILING ADDRESS OF THE BENEFICIARY WITH TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS.</STRON=

<P><STRONG><BR>&nbsp;</P></STRONG>
<P><STRONG>Upon the receipt of this information, the documents and approv=
al with the text will be sent to you for confirmation and then forwarded =
to the organization for ratification and subsequent payment. As with the =
case of all organized (sensitive) and conspired DEALS, we solicit for you=
r unreserved</STRONG></P>

 retire peacefully and lead a honourable business life afterwards. There =
