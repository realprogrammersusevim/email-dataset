Dear Friend,
In my quest to discover and properly scrutinize record of digits in my =
office, as an experienced banker. I got this to tell you, I discovered a =
DORMANT ACCOUNT worth (US$26,000,000.00) Twenty Six Million U.S. Dollars, in =
our bank.
Anyway, I am Dr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, the Auditor and Computing Manager of =
UNITED TRUST INTERNATIONAL Bank (UTIB) Dubai-UNITED ARAB EMIRATES. There =
exist an account opened in this bank in 1998 and since 1999 nobody has =
operated this account. I discovered from records that Mr. Jean-Marie LEVEQUE, =
a foreigner and the manager of the Petrol Chemical Service, and also Chemical =
Engineer by profession owns this account.
 Moreso, this money will be forfeited if not claimed and only a foreigner can =
effect claim this money. Secondly, no local bank here will be allowed to have =
this money, so it can only be claimed with foreign account owing to the fact =
that the former owner was a foreigner too and the money is in US dollars. So =
let this not be a surprise, I am contacting you on trust and because you are =
a foreigner as well.
 In fact, I want us to claim this money into a foreign account or any account =
of your choice. When the transfer is approved and payment schedule is =
allotted overseas, through the offshore paying delegate for final clearance =
and signing of the payment release form by the beneficiary; I would want us =
to see at the overseas payment clearance office or during the signing of the =
Original Binding Agreement, 
which binds us together and will also enables us receive this money into =
foreign account. This transaction will be 100% risk free and in accordance =
with the lay down rules, guiding the transactions in the banking industry. 
 The bank is ready to approve the payment of this money to any foreigner who =
has the correct information to this account, which I will give to you. When I =
am sure of your capability to handle such money in strict confidence and =
trust, 
according to the instructions and advise for our mutual benefit. Because I =
wouldn't want to make mistakes. So your assurance and trust is very important =
here. I shall destroy immediately documents concerning this transaction after =
we must have received this money, thereby leaving no trace.
 With my position in the bank, there will be no hindrance in legal approvals =
and onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance =
from foreign payment department, with assurance that this money will be =
intact pending my arrival abroad to take my share.
 Conclusively, you will be given 25% of the total amount, 70% will be for me, =
while 5% will be for expenses both parties must have incurred during the =
process of this transaction.
 
I look forward to your swift response.
 
Best regards,
DR. ATEEQ RAHMAN KHAN
