handed me over all the documents relating to the
deposit in the security company and asked me to leave for
SOUTH AFRICA and arrange with a foreign partner to invest
the money so that my child could have a better life and
take a good care of me.

located the SECURITY COMPANY and all modalities have been
put in place to transfer this money abroad. I therefore
