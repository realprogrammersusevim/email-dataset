Opportunities like this only come to one once in a lifetime.
I am Bala Mancha, a director with the Power and Steel Department and the =
Secretary of my country=92s Contracts Review Panel (CRP). This profitable =
venture involves the sum of US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five hundred =

In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance as a =
foreigner, to enable us transfer into your nominated account this sum of =
US$12,500,000.00 (Twelve Million Five hundred thousand United States =
Dollars). We cannot make this transfer on our own or in our names for the =
fact that we are civil servants (still in active service). But you as a =
foreigner can assist us in the sense that the money to be transferred will be =
paid to you as a contract entitlement for a purported contract executed for =
my government. The source of the funds are as follows: During the last =
military regime in my country, government officials set up companies and =
awarded themselves contracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various =
ministries and parastatals.
The present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which has =
the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by the =
decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessary pay =
those who are being owed outstanding amounts. The money in question is ready =
for transfer into an overseas account, which we expect you to provide.
We have agreed that the money will be shared according to the ratio Stated =
below;
(i) 25% to the account owner (you).
(ii) 65% for us (the panel officials).
(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us)incidental =
to the actualization of this project.
We will require from you:
a) Name and address of Company/Beneficiary, telephone and fax numbers.
b) Bank name, address, telephone and fax numbers and Details of the Account, =
which you are the only signatory that the money will be Transferred into. We =
do not mind if the account is a zero-based account or an account with no =
funds in it so long as it is functional for this purpose.
The above requirements are to legalize the claim for payment and transfer of =
the money to your account. Be informed that the reason we are sending you =
this letter is because we know that the only way to succeed is to seek the =
help of a foreigner. Your professional status is not a matter of hindrance in =
this transaction. Please, your assistance is highly solicited. We have no =
doubts at all that this money will be released and transferred if we get the =
necessary foreign partner to assist us in this deal.
Therefore, when the business is successfully concluded we shall through the =
same connections withdraw all documents used from all the concerned =
government ministries for 100% security. All expenses regarding the opening =
of an account if not already in existence shall be borne by you, all expenses =
is however reimbursable on the conclusion of this business transaction.
It is of high hope that you will consider this humble request and Respond =
positively. If you are still in doubt after the receipt of this letter please =
do not hesitate to contact and ask any question(s) that may hinder your =
decision on this matter via my telephone number
234-1-776-7324 or through the above email address and/or fax number.

awaiting your early response, thank you in anticipation of your most valued =
