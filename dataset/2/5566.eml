My name is Daniel Williams and I am an artist.I live in Netherlands,with my two
kids, four cats, one dog and the love of my life. It is definitely a full
house. I have been doing artwork since I was a small child. That gives me about
23 years of experience. I majored in art in high school and took a few college
art courses. Most of my work is done in either pencil or airbrush mixed with
color pencils. I have recently added designing and creating artwork on the
computer.I have been selling my art for the last 3 years and have had my work
featured on trading cards, prints and in magazines.I have sold in galleries and
to private collectors from all around the world.I am always facing serious
difficulties when it comes to selling my art works to Americans,they are always
offering to pay with a US POSTAL MONEY ORDER,which is difficult for me to cash
here in Netherland.

I am looking for a representative in the states who will be working for me and
will be willing to pay %10 for every transaction,which wouldnt affect ur
present state of work,someone who would help me recieve payments from my
customers in the states.These payments are in money order and it will be made
payable to your name, so all you need do is cash the money order deduct your
percentage and wire the rest back.

It wouldnt cost you any amount,you are to receive payments which will be sent
by my customers to you via fedex.

If you are interested,please get back to me as soon as possible.

Regards
Daniel Williams
