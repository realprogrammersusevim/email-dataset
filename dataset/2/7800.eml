After a month=2C we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers=2C the South African Mining Corporation that Mr=2E Ken 
Power
died from an automobile accident=2E On further investigation=2C I found out 
that
he died without making a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin 
was
fruitless=2E I therefore made further investigation and discovered that 
Mr=2E
Ken Power did not declare any next of kin or relations in all his 
official
documents=2C including his Bank Deposit paper work in my Bank=2E This sum 
of
$28=2C000=2C000=2E00 USD is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is 
being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year=2E

No one will ever come forward to claim it=2E According to South African 
Law=2C
at the expiration of 5 =28five=29 years=2C the money will revert to the 
ownership
of the South African Government if nobody applies to claim the funds=2E
Consequently=2C my proposal is that I would like you to stand in as the 
next
of kin to Mr=2E Ken Power so that the fruits of this old man's labour 
will not
get into the hands of some corrupt government officials=2E This is 
simple=2C I
will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so 
that the
Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits which will 
put
you in place as the next of kin=2E

We shall employ the service of an Accredited Attorney for drafting and
notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and 
letter of
Probate=2FAdministration in your favour for the transfer=2E A bank Account 
in
any part of the world which you will provide will then facilitate the
transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary=2Fnext of kin=2E The money 
will
be paid into your Account for us to share in the ration of 60% for me 
and
40% for you=2E

done
by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction=2E If you are interested=2C please
