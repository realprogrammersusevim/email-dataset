My Dear Friend,=20


I am Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha, wife to the late Nigerian Head of state, Gen=
eral Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June 1998 while still on active s=
ervice for our Country. I am contacting you with the hope that you will b=
e of great assistance to me, I currently have within my reach the sum of =
24 million U.S dollars cash which I intend to use for investment purposes=
 outside Nigeria.=20


This money came as a result of a payback contract deal between my husband=
 and a Russian firm in our country's multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta steel =
plant. The Russian partners returned my husbands share being the above su=
m after his death. Presently, the new civilian Government has intensified=
 their probe into my husbands financial resources which has led to the fr=
eezing of all our accounts, local and foreign, the revoking of all our bu=
siness licences and the arrest of my First son. In view of this I acted v=
ery fast to withdraw this money from one of our finance houses before it =
was closed down. I have deposited the money in a security company with th=
e help of very loyal officials of my late husband. No record is known abo=
ut this fund by the government because there is no  documentation showing=
 that we received such funds. The consignment was kept on an "OPEN BENEFI=
CIARY MANDATE" with the Security Company to avoid detection, seizure or d=
iversion.


Due to the current situation in the country and government attitude to my=
 family, I cannot make use of this money within, thus I seek your help in=
 transferring this funds out of the sub-African region. Bearing in mind t=
hat you may assist me, l have decided

to part with 20% of the total sum.=20


Please kindly reply through  this email address: aba_locate@yahoo.com.hk =
 with your letter of acceptance and your willingness in assisting me to r=
eceive the fund,also include your Physical Address, personal telephone an=
d fax numbers.=20


Your URGENT response is needed.=20


Regards,=20


Dr. Mrs. Mariam Abacha.
