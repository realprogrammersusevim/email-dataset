CONFIDENTIAL/URGENT BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
Dear Friend,

I am delighted to write this letter to you hoping that you will understan=
d
my predicament and answer back without hesitation.

I am Dr Maryam Abacha the wife of the late Nigerian head of State General=

Sani Abacha. I got your contact on the internet as I was making contact
for a honest foreigner who will help save my life and my children, hence
our country has been frustrating us since the death of my husband.

I am in possession of $25 000.000 (TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS ONLY)
which I want to invest in your country. For your clarification and unders=
tanding,this
money in a box which my husband deposited in the finance and security com=
pany
in dis-guise as a family treasure since 11th of febuary 1998, is not an
ill gotten wealth rather, it was generated from my organisation FAMILY SU=
PPORT
PROGRAM (F.S.P). I will enlighten you more of this organisation if you in=
dicate
a helping interest to secure this money on my behalf.

On your acceptance to render this assistance to me,I will instruct the fi=
nance
company to effect a change of ownership of this fund in your name as the
bona-fide owner to enable you claim the fund from the security and financ=
e
company,also I will disclose to you the country and the name of the finan=
ce
and security company where this money is being deposited.

What I demand from you now is to arrange for a visit to the finance compa=
ny
where this money is being deposited and claim it as the bona-fide owner.I=
t
is very ideal you forward to me your private telephone and fax numbers to=

enable me send all relevant documents pertaining the deposit of this fund=

for your clarification and more understanding.

Bear in mind that this transaction demands absolute confidentiality becau=
se
properties and bank accounts both local and international bearing the Aba=
cha's
family name, are being ordered to be confiscated by the newly elected civ=
ilian
President of Nigeria (President Olusegun Obasanjo) hence I will not want
to be exposed.

Let me refer you to the front page of This Day Newspapers of 10th March
2001. You can check it through their website:www.thisdayonline.com , clic=
k
on archives,8th.june,2001) The present government in Nigeria had frozen
and seized all my bank accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad.

Thus l shall expect you to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in de=
tail
about this transaction For your knowledge, 25% of this fund $25 000.000
(TWENTY FIVE MILLION U.S DOLLARS) will be given to you if you assist me
to secure this fund and another 5% has been set aside for all the expense=
s
you might incure during the process of securing this fund.Example: TELEPH=
ONE
BILLS, HOTEL BILLS, FLIGHT BILLS and other mislenous expenses.

When you must have taken the agreed percentage, you will use part of the
balance to buy a living house for my family there in your country, where
we shall live in the future and the remaining part will be kept for inves=
tment
package also in your country which will be under your supervision.

Contact me through my son (OMAR ABACHA) who recently escaped from Nigeria=

to Johannesboug South Africa where he is now staying as a refuge on his
email address omarabacha@hotmail.com to avoid us losing this money, since=

it is the only remaining fund for the survival of my family.

Thanks for your anticipated co-operation.
Yours sincerely,

MRS.MARYAM ABACHA
