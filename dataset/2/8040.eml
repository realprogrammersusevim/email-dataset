Compliments Of The Season 2006,

     Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise an=
d 
may offend your personality for contacting you without your prior consent=
 and 
writing through this channel.I got your contact from the proffesional dat=
a base 
found in the internet Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a for=
eign reliable partner.I assured of your capability and reliability to cha=
mpion this businees opportunity.

     After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contact y=
ou 
among other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I believe t=
hat God has a way of helping who is in need.

   I am (Joe Kekabu Esq),the Head of file Department in African developen=
t bank (ADB).

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dol=
lars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one=
 of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday=
 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his dea=
th, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his mon=
ey because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of=
 kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines=
, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relati=
on died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for t=
he claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in =
my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and rele=
ase the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for s=
afety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we do=
n=92t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained=
 unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank tr=
easury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this=
 business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, an=
d a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 3=
0 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the p=
rovision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incure=
d during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. Th=
ere after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the per=
centages indicated. 

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arrang=
ed, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the d=
eceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private=
 telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and locati=
on where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will se=
nd to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to =
bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you sho=
uld not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been=
 made for thetransfer. 

You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97 immediately as soon a=
s you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. 

Your=92s faithfully, 

Joe Kekabu (Esq.)
FROM (ADB) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.
GOD BLESSINGS,PROTECTIONS AND GUIDIANCE TO YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.  

POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer=
 to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As yo=
u finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss ver=
y well over this business.
