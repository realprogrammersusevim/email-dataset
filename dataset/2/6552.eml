Dear,

I am the head of Accounts and Audit Department of Bank of Africa,
Ouagadougou . I decided to contact you after a careful thought that you may 
be capable of handling this business transaction which i explained below;

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10.5m US dollars (Ten 
million, five hundred thousand US dollars). In an account that belongs to 
one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in 1998 in 
a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been 
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot 
release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the 
deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt 
that his supposed next of kin(his son and wife) died alongside with him at 
the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim .

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my 
department now decided to make this business proposal to you and release the 
money to you as the next of kin (We want to present you as his busines 
asociate )to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
Unclaimed after seven years, the money will be transferred into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner .We agree that 30% of 
this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision 
of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incurred during 
the business and 60% would be for me and my colleagues.

There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for disbursement 
according to the percentages indicated. Therefore to enable the immediate 
transfer of this fund to your account as arranged,you must apply first to 
the bank as next of kin of the deceased customer. Upon receipt of your 
reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application. I 
will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free 
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required 
arrangements have been made for the transfer.

I expect that you contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Hoping to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully,
DR .ABU TOPIA
