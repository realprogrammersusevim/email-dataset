you on this magintude and lucrative transaction for our present and future 
survival in life.Moreover, i have laid all the solemn trust in you before i

regulations which was signed lawfully that if such fund remains unclaimed  
till the period of 4 years started  from the date when the beneficiary died, 
the money will be transferred into the treasury as an unclaimed
