Turey. My fathe
  was a highly reputable business magnet (a cocoa, diamond and gold merch=
ant).It was sad to say that he passed away mysteriously after a business =
trips abroad. Though his sudden death was linked or rather suspected to h=
ave been masterminded by one of my uncle ,but God knows the truth!
  Sorry to say that I never know the caring of my mother because she died=
 when I was just 4 years old which made me the best man for my late fathe=
r and he never hide anything from me.=20
  Before he made the trip to France that lead to my misfortune(his death)=
He called me, explained to me the reason why he will make the trip...and =
also told me that he has the sum of Nine million, Five hundred thousand U=
nited State Dollars.(USD$9.500,000)deposited in one of the security compa=
ny's here in Abidjan Ivory coast West Africa, which he disguised and decl=
ared the box to contain family valuables instead of money, by this way th=
e company does not know the true content of the box.The=20
deposit document which I have in my possession carries my late father's n=
ame=20
as the depositor, while I'm the next of kin on the same document.I evacua=
ted from Sierra Leone last week because the deposit that was made by my l=
ate father secretly in Abidjan,Cote d'Ivoire and also with the fear of my=
 greedy relations.=20
  I arrived in Abidjan Cote d'Ivoire same last week but Ivory Coast or Co=
te d'Ivoire is a French speaking country and as a result of Language barr=
ier am more or less confused on who to  confide in over my inherited heal=
th, that's why I am confiding in you because is my wish to evacuate and r=
elocate out entirely from Africa with my=20
inherited wealth to start a new life.=20
  I have no documentary problems with the security company but the only p=
roblem is the nature of deposit that was made by my late father which I w=
ill explain to you once you declare your wiliness to assist me.
  Really, the death of my father actually brought sorrow to my life. I am=
 in a sincere desire of your humble assistance in this regards. Your sugg=
estions and ideas will be highly regarded.
