Exchange (S.A.I.E) regarding your trust worthy, as such; I
decided to ask for your assistance to transfer some money
Out of South Africa into your personal or company account.

Be fore my father's death, he was the General in charge of
Arms and Ammunition purchase for the Republic of Angola
Arms Forces. And in his will he specifically drew my
at! tention to the sum of US$35.7 MIL! LION United State
