<DIV>Yuri Konovalov<BR>General Director Novokuibyshersk Oil, <BR>RESPOND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO HELP</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Dear friend,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>I have sent you this mail because of the need to open discussions with <BR>you. I don't want you to misunderstand this offer in any aspect, if it <BR>is okay with you I ask for your full cooperation. I am Yuri Konovalov, the General Director of Novokuibyshersk Oil an international affiliate <BR>of Yukos Oil and Gas Company based in Russia. Due to ill Health I have <BR>esophageal cancer, it has defiled all forms of medical treatment and <BR>according to the medical experts it is a terminal illness so I do not <BR>know how much longer I have to live. </DIV>
<DIV><BR>I never had any real Friends in my lifetime because I never really <BR>cared for anyone but my business. But now I know that there is more to life <BR>than making all the money in the world. However, certain unfolding <BR>events has made it very necessary for me to seek your help, my company is <BR>fighting investigations and bankruptcy due to the Yukos Oil problems in <BR>Russia, most of my assets were seized due to this case.<BR>Recently I received a bulk payment from South Africa Ministry for my <BR>last contract there. I instructed them specifically not to send the funds <BR>to Russia because of the problems, but that the funds to be deposited <BR>with a Finance and Security company in Europe on hold. A huge cash <BR>deposit of Twenty-Five Million dollars was domiciled with a finance/Security <BR>Company overseas to my knowledge only. This is the last of my assets, <BR>now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself <BR>anymore, I therefore 
 need you as a partner because you are a neutral <BR>party to help me collect this funds deposited with the security company and <BR>disburse it secretly based on instructions. </DIV>
<DIV><BR>Because my time is short I have decided to give most of this money to <BR>charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I <BR>do on earth. For all your good efforts you will receive 30% of the <BR>Funds and must disburse the rest based on instructions. I want you to <BR>understand my seriousness in this case and if you can<BR>handle the job kindly contact me on this email(<A href="mailto:y_konovalov@yahoo.com" target=_blank>y_konovalov@yahoo.com</A>)<BR>for security purposes. I have all the necessary documents on hand; <BR>please contact me ASAP so we can discuss more. </DIV>
<DIV><BR>Thank you for your anticipated cooperation. If you are not interested, <BR>please keep it to yourself and do not respond.</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>Best Regards,</DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
