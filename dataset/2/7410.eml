DR H.B OHAMS
Accountant,
The Nigeria National
Petroleum Corporation (NNPC)
LAGOS,NIGERIA .
STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL FOR MUTUAL BENEFIT
I am DR H.B OHAMS,one of the very many accountants of The Nigeria=20
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and I head a five man tender board in=
 charge of
contract award and payment approvals.
There were series of contracts executed by a consortion of multinationals i=
n the oil ndustry in favour of Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC=
).
The original value of some contracts done for my corperation were delebrate=
ly over invoiced for OUR own use in the sum $29mUSD (twenty nine Million Un=
ited States Dollars Only) which has now been approved and is now ready to b=
e transferred, being that the
companies that actually executed these contracts had been fully paid when t=
he projests
were officially commissioned.
It does not matter whether your company did the contract or not, the assump=
tion
is that your company won the major contract and sub-contracted it out to ot=
her ompanies.
Consequently, my colleaques and I are willing to transfer the total amount =
to your account for subsequent disbursement, since we as civil servants are=
 prohibited by the code of onduct bureau (civil service laws) from opening =
and or operating foreign accounts in our names.
WAITING FOR YOUR RESPONSE.THERE AND THEN I WILL GIVE YOU MORE DETAILS.

THANKS
DR H.B OHAMS
