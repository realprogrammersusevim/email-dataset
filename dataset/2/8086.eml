Dear Friend,
Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal ethics.
Introductorily, I am Dr. Goodluck Ennis. I am a seasoned Banker and an Economist.  

Please, I am in desperate need of receiving a secured assistance from you to facilitate the transfer of  One of US $1,050,000.00 Dollars [One Million, Fifty Thousand US Dollars] out from a domant account of one of my customers, Mr. Andy Anderson, an American immigrant.
Mr. Anderson died on the 4th of January 2004 in a mysterious boat mishap in the Niger Delta Area during a routine inspection of Oil Rigs. 

Since then his relatives and /or next of kin can not be reached and the Management may soon froze this Account;
I am his Account Officer, I  have not receive any formal letter of claim to this fund. Information available to me from the National Immigration office also, suggests that Mr. Anderson was single during his entry to my country, Nigeria.
I have confidentially discussed this issue with my boss and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner who can faithfully and confidentially stand in as his Next of Kin to enable us transfer this fund out. 
I am privy to all information needed to validate this claim.  
Kindly note, I am open and willing to enter into negotiation with you on your involvement in this matter
especially concerning your benefits and security.
I will provide you with more information on how we can go about this transaction.
Kindly provide me with your private contact telephone number; I want to talk to you in person. 
Thank you,
Yours Sincerely,
Dr. Goodluck Ennis.
