FROM GEORGE DUKE

PHONE +34 690 35 9947

Greeting,

This letter might surprise you because we have met neither in person 
nor by correspondence. But I believe it is one day that you get to know 
somebody either in physical or through correspondence that iswhy i am now 
in spain making this contart please  do call me on phone becaouse this is
very urgent business. 

I got your contact through some discreet inquire from the chamber of 
commerce and industry,you and your company were revealed as being quite 
astute in private entreprenuership.one has no doubt in your ability to 
handle a financial business transaction. 

However, I am the first son of His Royal Majesty,WIWA DUKE and the 
traditional ruler of Eleme Province in the oil area of Rivers State of 
Nigeria. I am making this contact to you in respect of US 20,000,000.00 
(twenty million United States Dollars) which I inherited from my late 
father the money was accumulated from royalties rapid to my father as 
compensation by the oil firms located in our area as a result of oil 
presence on our land which hamper agriculture which is our major source of 
livelihood. Unfortunately my father died from protracted diabetes. But 
before his death he called my attention and informed me that he lodged 
some funds on two boxes with a security firm with an open beneficiary 
status. The lodgment Security Code Number

was also revealed to me, he then advised me to look for a reliable 
business partner abroad, who will assist me in investing the money in a 
lucrative business as a result of economic instability in Nigeria. So this 
is the main reason why I am contacting you for us to move this money 
from the security firm to any country of your choice for investment 
purposes. So I will like you to be the ultimate beneficiary, so that the 
funds can be moved in your name and particulary to any country of your 
choice where it will be claimed and invested. Hence my father have had 
intimated the security firm personnel that the beneficiary of the Box is 
his foreign partner whose particulars will be forwarded to the firm when 
due. But I will guide you accordingly. As soon as the fund reaches, I 
will then come over to meet you in person, so that we can discuss 
physically on Investment potentials. 

Based on this I and my family have unanimously decided to give you 20% 
of the total money, 2% for charity homes and 3% for expenses, which may 
arise during the transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. The 
balance of 75% you will invest and manage for my family. 

I hereby guarantee you that this is not government money, it is not 
drug money and it is not money from arms deal.

Though you have to maintain high degree of confidentiality on this 
matter. I will give you

all proof of deposit and existence of money once assured and fully 
satisfied with your capability and honesty. I hope this will be the 
beginning of a prosperous relationship between my family and your family.

Nevertheless if you are for any reason not interest, kindly inform me 
immediately so that I will look for another contact. 

I am waiting for your quick

response.

Yours faithfully

PRINCE GEORGE DUKE
