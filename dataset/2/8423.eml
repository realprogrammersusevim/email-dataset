MY REQUEST
In order to transfer out ( fifteen-million pounds sterlings) 
from our Bank here in london. I have the courage to look for a reliable 
and honest person who will be capable for this important transaction, 
believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I 
am, Mr Jim Harry. the Auditor and head of computing department of a 
Bank here in scotland united kingdom. there is an account opened in 
this bank in 1995 and since 2001 nobody has operated on this account 
again, After going through some old files in the records, I discovered 
that if i do not remitt this money out urgentely, It will be forfeited 
for nothing.

How the money came about:
The owner of this account is, 
Mr Lewis Mowan, A foreigner and manager of petrol chemical service here 
in london, A chemical engineer by proffession and he died since 2001 
and then, Since 2001 nobody knows about this account or anything 
concerning it, The account has no other beneficiary and my 
investigation proved to me as well that his company does not know 
anything about this account and the amount involved is (15,000,000.00) 
pounds sterlings. I am contacting you because of the need to involve a 
foreigner with a foreign account as the real beneficiary.Finally, At 
the conclusion of this business you will be given 25% of the total 
ammount,5% will be for expenses both parties might have incured during 
the process of this transaction.Your urgent respons is needed.
Thanks.
Mr Jim Harry.
