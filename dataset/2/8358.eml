ATTN; C.E.O/MD

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me 
personally, the purpose of my introduction is that, I am MARK ANDERSON the 
first son of MICHEAL ANDERSON who was recently murdered in the land dispute 
in Zimbabwe.I got your contact from world online in e-mail data services of 
south africa chamber of commerce and industry in my search for reliable 
individual or company to assist me in this transfer business transaction.

Before the death of my father, he had taken me to Johannesburg to deposit 
the sum of US$25Million(twenty five million United States Dollars),in one 
the private security company, as if he foresaw the looming danger in 
Zimbabwe.This money was deposited in a box as germ stones to avoid much 
demurrage from Security Company.This amount was meant for the purchase of 
new machines and chemicals for the farms and established of new farm in 
Swaziland.

This land problem came when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe introduce 
a new Land Act reform which wholly affected the rich white farmers and some 
few blacks farmers.And  this resulted to the killing and mob action by 
Zimbabwean war veterans and some lunatics in the society.  In fact, a lot of 
people were killed because of this land reformed Act for which my father was 
one of the victim.

It is against this background that, I and my family who are currently 
staying in South Africa decided to transfer my father?s money to foreign 
account since the law of South Africa prohibit a refugee (asylum seeker) to 
open any bank account or to be involved in any financial transaction 
throughout the teritorial zone South Africa. As the eldest son of my father, 
I am saddle with the responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account 
where this money could be transferred without the knowledge of my government 
who are bent on taking everything we have got. The South African government 
seems to be playing along with them. I am faced with the dilemma of 
investing this amount of money in South Africa for fear of going through the 
same experience in future since both countries have similar political 
history. Moreover, the South African Foreign Exchange policy does not allow 
such investment for an asylum seeker.

As a businessman, who I have to entrust my future and of my family in his 
hands, I must let you know that this transaction is risk free.  If you 
accept to assist me and my family all I want you to do for me is to make 
arrangements and come to Johannesburg ? South Africa, so that you can open a 
non-resident account which will aid us in transferring the money into any 
account you will nominate overseas.  This money I intend to use for 
investment.

I have two options for you, firstly you can choose to have certain 
percentage of the money for nominating your account for this transaction.Or 
you can go into partnership with me for the proper profitable investment of 
the money in your country.  Whichever the options you want, feel free to 
notify me I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all kinds of expenses 
incurred in the process of this transaction. If you do not prefer a 
partnership I am willing to
give you 25% of the money while the remaining 70% will be for my investment 
in your country.

Contact me with the above E-mail while I implore you to maintain the 
absolute secrect required in this transaction.
Yours Faithfully,
MARK ANDERSON
