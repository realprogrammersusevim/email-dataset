FROM CHIEF AMAH KWAKU:

Sir/Madam,

I am Chief Amah Kwaku. I represent the head of a royal family right here
in Ghana.

Every four months, my family is entitled to receive 350 Kilograms of
alluvial  gold as royalty from a reputable mining company in Ghana.

We have been cheated in the past by some group of people who had deceived
us under force pretence that they would assist us to sell our gold in the
foreign market. In order to get out of these cheats repeating their acts,
we are soliciting for a reasonable, matured and honest person who can
assist us in the foreign market to sell what we have at hand right now.

Be informed that this will be a continuous business once you prove
reliable and competent,

Please do reply at  amahkwaku1966@aim.com  if you are interested to assist
us.

Regards,

Chief Amah Kwaku
