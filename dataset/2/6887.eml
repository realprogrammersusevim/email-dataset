Private and Confidential
Dear Sir=2C

You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not
know me personally=2E I am Mr=2E Williams savimbi =28Jnr=29 the first son of 
MR=2ENKONNOH SAVIMBI=2C who was recently murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe=2E
I got your contact through my research in the South African Chambers of
Commerce & Industries for a responsible and a God fearing person who I
can trust by using his personality and his bank account for this
transaction=2E When I got your contact=2C I prayed over it then I decided 
to write to you=2E

Before the death of my father=2C he deposited the sum of USD$10 Million 
=28TENMILLION UNITDED STATES DOLLARS=29 in one of the private security 
companies=2C in Johannesburg South Africa as if he fore saw the looming danger in 
Zimbabwe=2E

This money is protected in a big metal box and was declared to the
security company at the point of deposit as precious valuables e=2Eg=2E=3A 
Gold=2C diamond and germ stone to avoid the security company knowing that the 
content of the consignment deposited with them contains cash=2E This amount was 
meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the farms and 
establishment of a new farm in Swaziland=2E

This land problem came when Zimbabwe President MR=2EROBERT MUGABE
introduced a New Land Act reform=2C which wholly affected the rich white 
and some few black farmers=2E This resulted to killing and mob action by Zimbabwean 
warveterans=2E In fact=2C a lot of people were killed because of this land 
reform act for which my father was one of the victims=2E

It is for this reason that my family and i who are staying in South
Africa now as refugees have decided to transfer my father's money to a 
foreign country since the law of South Africa prohibits a person with a refugee 
status to operate a bank account or do any banking transaction in South 
Africa=2E

As the only son of my father=2C I am saddled with the responsibility of
seeking for a genuine foreign account where this money could be 
transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on my family=2E I 
must also let you know that this transaction is 100%risk free=2E

If you are really capable and willing to assist me=2C I and my family has
promised to give you 30% of the total money=2C 10% is for the expenses
that may occur during the time of the transaction and the rest of the 
70%is for me and my family for the investment in your country=2E

Please contact me immediately with the above recommended private
e-mail=3Awilliam=5Fsavimbi2001=40yahoo=2Ecom phone 27-833-515247 indicating 
your interest=2E Please be aware that confidentiality and urgency is very 
vital to this transaction=2E

Thanks for your mutual co-operation as I expect your soonest response=2E

Best regards

Mr=2E Williams Savimbi
