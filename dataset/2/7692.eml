MR.ROBERT WILSON.
From: Mr. Robert Wilson.
15 Shevron Dredging Road,
P O Box 256
Calabar.
Cross River State,
Nigeria.
I am a financial consultant based in Calabar, Nigeria. 
I have a client who is presently in exile here in Nigeria. 
Pressures are mounting on my client to face alleged war
crimes. 
Many of this trumpeted charges are baseless and cannot hold
since agreement were reached before he peacefully handed
over to the present leadership.I have to be protective of
my client at this early stage but the following websites
will give you a background who my client is.

My client desires to secure his funds that are already in a
security company in Europe.The security company has liaison
offices in Asia and Uk & Europe.It was on September 20,
1998, that my client transferred the fund to the custodian
of the Security Company on hold for six years.
The exile situation coupled with the clamor for court
threat has placed my client under a precarious situation
thereby making it impossible for him or his family have
direct access to the fund. 
Consequently, my client is willing to offer you 20% of the
total fund,if you can assist him transfer this fund to your
country or any bank of your choice. He wishes to invest in
a stable economy.His interest is in companies with
potentials for rapid growth in long terms. Also, should
you wish, my client is interested in placing part of his
fund in your company, if your country?s bi-laws allows
foreign investment.
For the security of my client, the amount involved, name of
security company and the particular country is not
disclosed herein not knowing what your action or reaction
might be on receiving this proposal.
Rest assured that on your consent, this information would
be freely shared with you.
You can contact me for more details via my private e-mail

Yours faithfully,
Mr.Robert Wilson
