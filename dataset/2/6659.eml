Dear sir,

Thank you for your recent online Refinance Application with E-Loan Inc.
Apparently you have moved from your current home address a couple of months ago, so we coulnd't verify your identity with Credit Bureaus and Chexsystems.
We are sorry for any inconvenience.

Attached are scanned copies of your Home Value, Grant Deeds and your current Credit Profile from 3 major Credit Bureaus. Take a close look at it, as you will receive hard copies by usps mail in few days.
