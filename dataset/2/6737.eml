NOTIFICATION OF BEQUEST

On behalf of the Trustes and Executor of the estate of Late Engr. David
Jones, I once again try to notify you as my earlier letter to you
through the Post Office was returned undelivered. I hereby attempt to
reach you via your e-mail address.

I wish to notify you that late Engr.David Jones made you a beneficiary
to his will. He left the sum of Seven Hundred and Fifty Thousand Dollars
(US$750,000) to you in the codicil and last testament to his will. Being
a widely traveled man, he must have been in contact with you in the past
or simply you were nominated to him by one of his numerous friends
abroad who wished you good.Engr.David Jones until his death was a former
managing director and pioneer staff of a giant construction company. He
was a very dedicated Christian who loved to give out. His great
philanthropy earned him numerous awards during his lifetime.

Late Engr. David Jones died on the 9th day of February 2002 at the age
of 82 years, and his Will is now ready for execution. According to him
this money is to support your Christian activities and to help the poor
and the needy Please If I reach you, as I am hopeful, endeavor to get
back to me as soon as possible to enable the immediate execution of your
portion of the bequest to enable earlier disbursement by the Paying
Bank. You should forward along your telephone and fax numbers, including
a proof to confirm your identity as the beneficiary in question and your
current mailing address if different from the above. Proof of Identity
should be either clergy ID or International passport or drivers License.
Send machine copy or identity proof by attachment via E-mail On demand I
would send you the Obituary notice of Late David Jones for your perusal
and maybe you would recognize him.

I hope to hear from you in no distant time.

Yours in His service

Rev Fr. john Cohen (smm.)
