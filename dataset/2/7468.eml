FIRST BANK OF NIGERIA Plc. 

Marina,Lagos-Nigeria.



Dear Sir, 



I am Prince James Irabo. from the First Bank of 

Nigeria Plc,Lagos Branch.I got your contact through.the 

internet I have urgent and very confidential business 

proposal for you. On January 7, 1999, an America

Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian National

Petroleum Corporation,Mr. Charles Ballassi made a numbered

time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at

US$9,700,000.00(Nine Million Seven Hundred Thousand

Dollars)in my branch upon maturity. I sent a rountine

notification to his forwarding address but got no

reply.After a month,wesent a reminder and finally we

discovered from his contract employers,the Nigerian 

National Petroleum Corporation that Mr.Charles Ballassi 

died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999[with Egyptian 

990] with other passengers aboaed as you can confirm it 

yourself via the website below: 

http://www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html

on further investigation, i found out that he died without 

making a WILL, and attempts to trace his next of kin was 

fruitless.I therefore made further investigation

and discovered that Mr. Charles Ballassi did not declare

any next of kin or relations in all his official 

documents,including his bank deposit paperwork in my bank. This sum 

ofUS$9,700,000.00 is still in my bank and the interest is 

being rolled over with the pricipal sum at the end of 

eachyear. No one will ever come forward to claim 

it.According to Nigerian law, at the expiration of 

(Six)years, the money will revert to the ownership of the

Nigerian Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently,my proposal is that i will like you as a 

foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Charles 

Ballassi so that the fruit of this old man's labour will 

not get into the hands of some corrupt Government 

officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide 

immediately yourfull name and address so that the Attorney will preparethe 

necessary documents and affidavits which will put you in 

place as the next of kin.We shall employ the service of 

two attorney for the drafting and notarization of the WILL 

and obtain the ecessary documents and letter of

probate/administration in your favour for the transfer.Any 

bank account in any part of the world which you will 

provide will then facilitate the transfer of this money to 

you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will

be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% 

for me and 40% for you. There is no risk at all, the 

paperwork for this transaction will be done by the 

attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees 

the successful execution of ths transaction. If you are 

interested,please reply immediately via the private email 

address below,upon your responce,i shall provide you with 

more details and relevant documents that will help you 

understand the transaction. Please observe utmost 

confidentiality and be rest assured that this transaction

would be most profitable for both of us because i shall

require your assitance to invest my share in your country.
