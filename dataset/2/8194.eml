worth $18,000,000 million dollar in an account offshore. If you can be 
a collaborator to this please indicate interest immediately for us to 
proceed. First transfer to your account Will be $8 million.
You will 
keep 30% percent interest of the total Fund.10% for charity both in 
Africa and in your country while the remaining 5% will be set aside to 
settle expenses both parties might incure during the transfer process.

Your contact phone numbers and name will be necessary for this effect.
Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed 
information about the transaction.I will not fail to bring to your 
notice that this business is 100% risk and trouble free and that you
