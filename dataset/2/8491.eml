Hello,

My name is Sgt.Daniel Smith; I am a Briton and a member of the coalition 
force in Iraq,
I am serving in the military of the 1st Armored Division, insurgents attacks 
us daily. I managed to move money belonging to Saddam Hussein's family worth 
US$2, 000000.00.
The money is in a box and is currently in the custody of a finance/ security 
firm where I deposited it for safe-keeping purpose, till I find a reliable 
person that will make claim of it on my behalf as my partner, because due to 
my current engagement in the Army, my countrys government will take the 
money if found on me,I will take 70% and you will take 30%. No strings 
attached.
Kindly send me an e-mail signifying your interest including your contact 
details.
Respectfully,
Sgt. Daniel Smith
