 YTC INVITATION( CHINA) 

Dear Sir/Madam,
It is a pleasure to write to
you in respect of our company Yokoono trading
Company.
We are a small company located in China into
innovative, artistic examples of chinese art works
ranging from precious metals to sculpture and
paintings. These precious artifacts range from the Han
dynasty to the song dynasty and are highly authentic.
We held our first exhibition and Auction at which we
sold a lot of artifacts to the general public, after a
long period of collecting artifacts for purposes of
viewing. During the exhibition which was highly
successful, a lot of foreign buyers participated in
the sales and bought sculpture and paintings. However
some of these artifacts have not been paid for by
these clients. Much to our releif they have indicated
interest in paying for the goods. We have a problem of
distance,and language barriers not to mention
government if we trade outside China.We are
searching for representatives who can help us
establish a medium of getting our funds from our
costumers in the canada/america/europe as well as
making payments through you to us.Please if you
are interested in transacting business in view of helping
us,so our clients could make payment to you being a
representative for us we will be very glad.and

benefits. Please contact our uk based Executive representative/coordinator)
