I am Mrs. Shelly Brown from Netherlands,I am 58 years
old,i am suffering from a long time cancer of the breast which also affec=
ted my brain,from all indication my conditions is really deteriorating an=
d it is quite obvious that, according to my doctors they have advised me =
that i may not live for the next two months,this is because the
cancer stage has gotten to a very bad stage. I was brought up from a moth=
erless babies home was married to my late husband for twenty years withou=
t a child ,died in a
fatal motor accident Before his death we were true Christians.

Since his death I decided not to re-marry,I sold all
my inherited belongings and deposited all the sum of $8.6million dollars =
with a Security Company.Presently, this money is still with them and the =
management just
wrote me as the true owner to come forward to receive the money for keepi=
ng it so long or rather issue a letter of
authorization to somebody to receive it on my behalf since I can not come=
 over because of my illness or
they get it confisticated.

Presently, I'm with my laptop in a hospital where I
have been undergoing treatment for cancer of the lungs. I have since lost=
 my ability to talk and my doctors have told me that I have only a few mo=
nths to live.

It is my last wish to see that this money is invested
to any organisation of your choice and distributed each year among the ch=
arity organization,the poor and the motherless babies home where i come f=
rom.I want you God
fearing, to also use this money to fund churches,orphanages
and widows,I took this decision, before i rest in peace because my time w=
ill soon be up.

contact of the Security Company.I will also issue you a letter of authori=
ty that will prove you as the new beneficiary of my fund. Please assure m=
