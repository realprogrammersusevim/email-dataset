"How to turn 3 into 10,000" 
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but with a little effort will make a nice little return - perhaps pay off that credit card after the Xmas spend, or pay for that much needed holiday

Please take the time to read the following information, which I received recently.
 
Please try not to be sceptical about this program and at least think about it for a few days, otherwise you could be throwing away over 10,000 in cash! This system has worked for 2 years and the thousands of people, who joined, have been amazed by the results of giving a little time and just 3.00 (5/$5.00).

In March of 2003, I received a short and simple e-mail telling me how to make over 10,000 at a time. Of course I ignored it, but I didn't delete the mail, as there was something about it which rang true and I was keen to know if it was possible to make that amount of money in such a short space of time. I was at that time getting deep in debt. I finally realized that I had absolutely nothing to lose by having a go at the plan offered to me in that email. And apart from that, I just couldn't stop myself from thinking "What if it actually works?" For the sake of 3 isn't it worth a go!
I put my doubts to one side, went ahead and followed the simple instructions given in that email. It took me less than 30 minutes to complete and it cost me no more than 3 (5/$5). 

What did it say in that email? Well, if you'll read on, all will be revealed! 
The business plan I am about to share with you works perfectly every single time. I've never made less than 10,000 from it on each occasion. Let me assure you that this is a LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, a perfectly legal moneymaking enterprise. It does not require you to sell anything. It does not require you to speak to your friends, family or anybody else (unless you want to). 
This must sound like an outrageous claim, particularly if you've never had possession of this sort of money before, but believe me, this business works like nothing else you may have seen before in your life! By following the simple 3-step plan set out below, within a few short weeks your life could be transformed beyond all recognition! 

Please do not allow your initial scepticism to deprive you of financial success. 

This program is by no means new. It has been in existence in many forms for at least a decade. But in the early days, it required a lot more time and effort, as well as an outlay of a few hundred pounds. However, thanks to PayPal and the Internet, the outlay is now virtually ZERO! And what's more, the entire process is FASTER, EASIER, and MORE LUCRATIVE than it has EVER been! 
This program works no matter what country you are in, or what currency you use. It doesn't matter how old or how young you are. And you certainly won't need any special knowledge or talent. You won't need to run a website, or make phone calls, or make photocopies, or send out letters through the mail, or pay for advertising, etc. 

You will need:
	An email address 
	A Premier or Business PayPal account with at least 3 (5/$5) deposited in it 
	30 minutes of your time 

PayPal is the simplest method of sending and receiving payments online that anyone has ever seen! Once you have a PayPal account, you can send and receive credit card payments to or from anyone - anywhere in the world! However, please read further before you visit their website. 

To get started, follow the instructions exactly as set out below and then prepare yourself for an influx of cash over the next 30 days! 

Here's what you need to do:
STEP 1: If you're not already a PayPal user, the very first thing you need to do is click on the PayPal link below and SIGN UP. It takes just 2 minutes.
http:/www.paypal.com 
 
STEP 2: When you have opened your account, send a 3 (5/$5) payment from your PayPal account to the FIRST email address in the list below, along with a note saying: 
" Please add me to your mailing list. " 
Be certain to add this note, as this is what KEEPS THIS PROGRAM LEGAL. Instructions on how to send a payment are under "SEND MONEY" at the PayPal site. It's that easy!! 
Here's the current list: 

1.	hurst_l@lineone.net
2.	admin@makinscentz.com
3.	tracy@chezmoi79.freeserve.co.uk
4.	charlotte2012@hotmail.co.uk
5.	kingsley.enterprise@tiscali.co.uk



STEP 3: Once you've sent a 3 (5/$5) payment to the address at the top of the list (along with your note - this is VERY important!), the next thing to do is copy the contents of this page, as you'll be sending it out (as an email message) to at least 40 people, although with the legitimate mailing lists and the different ways of advertising on the internet, e.g. Ebay, the amount of recipients of your mail could well exceed into the hundreds, thousands or even millions if you wish. The more people who join in, the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going to use a mailing list, please make sure it is from a reputable source and includes people who have "Opted In". These lists contain names of people who have no objections to receiving these types of mails. 

The e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any way you want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it).

Delete the e-mail address at No 1 in the list and move the others up one place (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2 etc)
No 5 in the list will be empty, so put YOUR address in this space. (This is the e-mail address you used to sign up to PayPal), your email is now ready for sending! 
A word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to position 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! If you do that, you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to, and then your address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you won't reach any more people! However, if you add your name to the No 5 position, there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sending e-mail's later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!! 

When you send out your e-mails, your address will initially be at No 5 in the list. The response-rate for this program is much higher than any typical email marketing campaign for a number of reasons, which are explained later. 
As long as you send your e-mails to people who are likely to be interested in this program, you can expect an average response from about 25% of the people you send to. Let's be conservative here and assume that you receive only an average response rate of 12.5%. 
If you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at least 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 40 = 5). By this time, your email address will have moved up to No 4 in the list, and this list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40). 
Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to participate (12.5% of 200 = 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails (25 x 40) being sent out and your email address will have risen to No 3 in the list. 
Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to participate (12.5% of 1,000 = 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails (125 x 40) being sent out with you now at the No 2 position. 
Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to respond (12.5% of 5,000 = 625), so that's 25,000 emails (625 x 40) being sent out with YOUR ADDRESS at the No 1 spot! 
Now, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to respond (12.5% of 25,000 = 3,125). And since you will now be at No 1 in the list, you will receive 3 (5/$5) from each of them, that's; 9,375 (3,125 x 3(5/$5).
 
So, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few days, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days the money will be sent to you, by a few thousand people just like yourself. The first payments will arrive within a few days, and they will continue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After that time, the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail address vacates the No 1 position.
