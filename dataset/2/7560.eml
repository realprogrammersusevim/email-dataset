My dear friend,=20

I am DR. Yetunde Bassey, Bank Manager of Diamond Bank of Nigeria,Lagos
Branch. I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for
you.=20

On June 6, 1999, a FOREIGN Oil consultant/contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation, Mr. Barry Kelly made a numbered time
(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$25,000,000.00
(Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.=20

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address
but got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we
discovered from his contract employers, the Nigerian National Petroleum
Corporation that Mr. Barry Kelly died from an=20
automobile accident.=20

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a
WILL, and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I
therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Barry Kelly
did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents,
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank.=20

This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each
year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.=20

According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the
money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody
applies to claim the fund.=20

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as an Foreigner to
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Barry Kelly so that the fruits of
this old
man=C3f=C6'=C3?=E2?T=C3f=E2?s=C3,=C2=A2=C3f=C6'=C3,=C2=A2=C3f=C2=A2=C3=A2=
=E2?s=C2=AC=C3.=C2=A1=C3f=E2?s=C3,=C2=AC=C3f=C6'=C3,=C2=A2=C3f=C2=A2=C3=A2=
=E2?s=C2=AC
=C3.=C2=BE=C3f=E2?s=C3,=C2=A2s labor will not get into the hands of some =
corrupt
government officials.=20

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names
and address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavits, which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall
employ the service of an Attorney for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and to obtain the necessary documents and letter of
probate/administration in your favor for the transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world, which you will provide, will
then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us
to share in the ratio of 65% for me, 30% for you and 5% would be for
settling expenses on my part and yours also for tax when the funds
arrive your country.=20

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will
be done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees
the successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested,
please reply immediately ONLY via any of my alternate private email
addresses below otherwise I would not respond to you.=20

Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and
relevant documents that will help you understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country. I look
forward to hearing from you soonest.

Thanks and regards.

DR. Yetunde Bassey
