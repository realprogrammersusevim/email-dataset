DEAR SIR : 

With due respect trust and humility, I write you this proposal, which I 
believe it will be a great interstto you.I found your contact while I 
was doing aprivate research on the internet for a reliable and capable 
foreign partner that will assist my family and me. That's why I 
contacted you. I am MRS.BRIDGET LUZA the wife of MR.MORRIS LUZA of 
Zimbabwe.During the current war against famers in Zimbabwe and from the 
support of our president ROBERT MUGABE to claim all the white owned 
farms in our country, all the white and black farmers were ordered to 
surrender their farms to his party members and his followers. My husband 
who was one of the best farmers in our country and treasurer of the 
farmer's CO-pperation did not suport his idea and so the party members 
invaded my husband's farms and burnt everything in the farm, Killed my 
husband and made away with a lot of items in my husband's farm. After the 
death of my husband, i and my childern decided to move out of zimbabwe 
because our lives were in danger with the money that my husband kept in 
his hidden safe in my house. The amount contained in the safe is US$11M 
(ELEVEN MILLION US DOLLAR) and we decided to move the money to the 
Republic of REPUBLIC OF GHANA. where we deposited the money with SECURITY 
COMPANY as a valuable item.So i decided to contact you to assist me to 
move this money out of GHANA, because we took anassyllum protection here 
in ghana So if you consider this proppsal, we have agreed to give you 
30% of the total sum for helping us to move this money out to your 
country and 10% will be mapped out for expenses both of us may incur during 
this transaction and 60% Will be for me and family to invest in your 
country You can contact me on this Email address for security reasons
