Pretoria=2C South Africa=2E

 Sir=2C

 On behalf of my colleagues and I=2C I write this
 letter with great pleasure=2E Your information were
 given to me by a member of the South African Export
 Promotion Council =28SAEPC=29 who was with the Black
 Economic Empowerment Commission =28Government=29
 delegation on a trip to the United States during a
 bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign
 investors=2E I have decided to seek a confidential
 co-operation with you in execution of a business
 transaction hereunder for the benefit of all
 parties=2E

 Within the Department of Mining Resources where I
 work as the Director of Project Implementation=2C with
 co-operation of two other top officials=2C we have in
 our possession=2C an overdue payment in US funds=2E

 The said funds represent certain percentage of the
 contract value executed on behalf of my Ministry by
 a foreign contracting firm=2C which we the officials
 over-invoiced to the amount of US$14=2C300=2C000=2E00
 =28Fourteen  Million=2C Three Hundred Thousand United
 States Dollars=29=2E Though the actual contract cost has
 been paid to the original contractor=2C leaving the
 excess balance unclaimed=2E

 The Government of the Republic of South Africa
 believe that private investment in general=2C and
 foreign direct investment in particular=2C are the
 real engines for sustainable economic development=2C
 for which reason it has continued to encourage
 investment in the key growth-oriented sector of
 Mining with sincere determination to pay foreign
 contractors all debts owed to them=2C so as to
 continue to enjoy close relationship=2C and a mutually
 beneficial co-operation with foreign governments and
 non-governmental financial agencies=2E As a result we
 included our bills for approvals with the
 co-operation of some officials at the Department of
 Finance and the Reserve Bank of South Africa =28RBSA=29=2E
 We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary
 of the unclaimed funds=2C since we are not allowed to
 operate a foreign account=2E The changing of
 beneficiary's information=2Fdetails and other forms of
 documentation upon application for claim to reflect
 the contract money and its approvals will be secured 
 on behalf of your company or your good self=2E
 I have the authority of my colleagues involved to
 propose that=2C should you be willing to assist us in
 this transaction your share as compensation will be
 30% while my colleagues and I shall receive 60%=2C and
 the balance of 10% shall be used to reimburse all
 expenditures=2C taxes and miscellaneous expenses so
 incurred=2E

 It does not matter whether or not your company does
 contract projects of the nature described here=2E The
 assumption is that your company won the major
 contract and subcontracted it to other companies=2E
 More often than not=2C big trading companies and firms
 of unrelated fields win major contracts=2C and
 subcontract to more specialized firms for execution=2E

 This business itself is 100% safe=2C provided you
 treat it with utmost confidentiality=2E Also your
 pecialization is not a hindrance to the successful
 execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction=2E I
 have reposed my confidence in you and hope that you
 will not disappoint us=2E

 your acceptance of this proposal=2E
