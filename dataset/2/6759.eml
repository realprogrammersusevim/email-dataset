REPLY TO peterdouglas@o2.pl

My Dear,

I am ENGR. PETERSIDE DOUGLAS, Director of Project,Department of Petroleum Resources.I am making this contact with you based on the committee's need for an individual/company who is willing to co operate with us to receive the floating Funds in my department.

This amount $15M represents the balance of the total contract value executed on behalf of Department of petroleum Resources by a foreign contracting firm, which we the officials over-invoiced deliberately, of which the actual sum has been paid.

I highly assure you that no risk is involved because this information is known only to you and my colleagues. As soon as I receive an acknowledgement of receipt and acceptance of our mutual business proposal,I will furnish you with the necessary step to follow and the sharing ratio.

I await your immediate response.

Yours faithfully,

Engr.Peterside Douglas
