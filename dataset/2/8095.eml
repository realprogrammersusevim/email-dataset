Dear Friend.

 As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for
 me, because, I believe everyone will die someday.

 My name is Saidi Fatou, a merchant in Dubai, in the
 U.A.E.I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer
 which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in
carrying for my health. It has defiled all forms of
 medicine, and right now I have only about a few
 months to live, according to medical experts.

 I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I
 never really cared for anyone not even myself but my
 business. Though I am very rich, I was never
 generous, I was always hostile to people and only
 focus on my business as that was the only thing I
cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know
that there is more to life than just wanting to have
 or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come
 to this world I would live my life a different way
 from how I have lived it. Now that God ! has called
 me, I have willed and given most of my properties
 and assets to my immediate and extended family
 members and as well as a few close friends.
 I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul
 and so, I have decided to give alms to charity
 organizations, as I want this to be one of the last
 good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed
 money to some charity organizations in the U.A.E,
 Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has
 deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this my self any
 more. I once asked members of my family to close one
 of my accounts and distribute the money which I have
 there to charity organization in Bulgaria and
 Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to
 themselves. Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as
 they seem not to be contended with what I have left
 for them.
 The last of my money which no one knows of is the
 huge cash deposit of twenty four million dollars
 that I have with a Bank in london.
 I will want you to help me collect this deposit and
dispatched it to charity organizations.email me
 at giversworld@fastermail.com
 I have set aside 10% for you for your time and
 patience.

God be with you.

 Saidi Fatou.
