Complement and Good Day.

I work in CBN Nigeria in remittance 
department, I saw a file in respect of your fund that has been 
abandoned amount in question $ 12.500.000.00 Million USD. And
your 
name 
is one of the FIVE people that their draft is ready to send to 
them. I 
suggest that I can assist you  in processing this fund 
installmentally, 
what I need from you is acceptance for me to go ahead 
and the end of 
the day 10% will be given  to me If it is ok by you, I 
will advice you 
to get back to me so that I will give you more 
details. and I will need 
your telephone number for further 
communication.
Be rest assured that 
everything is alright.

Thanks,

Mr.Ify Alamu
