Dear friend,
Compliment of the day, I JULIET UGAGA, The daughter of late General  KuJI =
UGAGA of the Democratic Republic of Congo.im married with two children.
 My father was a General in the Congolese Army. In his position (My father) =
with the office of the presidentcy during the regime of Laurent kabila, he =
was assigned on a secret mission to source and acquire arms  internationally =
in order to strengthen the Government forces against the rebels, which =
already had the support of Rwandan and Uganda Army.
 Meanwhile, he was still negotiating for the purchase of the arms, he =
received on the 16th January 2001 news of the assassination of Laurent Kabila =
which force him to call off the assignment and deposited the  sum of =
US$12.5M, Packed in a diplomatic case in a private security company in the =
Hague, the Netherlands, though he registered the content as precious  stones =
while the real content is (US12.5M) meant for the purchase of arms for  the =
Congolese Army. My father went home for the funeral of the late president, =
but on  his arrival he was arrested, detained and tortured, unfortunately my  =
father suffer cardiac arrest and died on the 17th of March 2001. However,one  =
of our
numerous visits, my mother and I paid him while in prison, my father  was =
able to reveal this secret to me and advice that we should proceed to  the =
Netherlands to claim the money, he handed me all the relevant  documents that=

will enable me claim the box from the security company.Already, I have  made =
my first visit to the security company and the document entitled to  clear =
this money is with a finance security company in Holland.
 On our arrival in the Netherlands few months ago, we sought for  political =
