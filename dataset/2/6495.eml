found out that he died without making a WILL=2C and all attempts to trace

ever come forward to claim it=2E According to Laws of Republic of China=2C

stand in as the next of kin to Mr=2E Smith Lawrence so that the fruits of
this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt
government officials=2E This is simple=2C I will like you to provide
immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will
prepare the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in
place as the next of kin=2E We shall employ the services of an attorney
for drafting and notarization of the WILL and to obtain the necessary
documents and letter of probate=2Fadministration in your favor for the
transfer=2E A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide
will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the
beneficiary=2Fnext of kin=2E The money will be paid into your account for
us to share in the ratio of 90% for me and 10% for you=2E
