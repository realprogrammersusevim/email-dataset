Dear Sir/Madam,


This letter might surprise you because we have met=0D
=
neither in person nor by correspondence. But I
believe it is one day tha=
t you get to know Somebody
either in physical or through correspondence=0D
=
I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust
to enable my colle=
agues and I carry out an urgent
business Opportunity in my department. I=
 am a director
with the Citizens Trust Bank Plc. 
I used to be a busine=
ss partner to one Mr. Ali B.
Ashraf who died along with his family on th=
e 8th of
November 1999 in an ADC Boeing 727 plane crash at
Egirin River=
. All 141 passengers on Boards were feared
dead.
He left in his domicil=
iary account the total sum of
$25.5 million (Fifteen million five hundre=
d thousand
USA Dollars).Since the management got the information
of his=
 death we have been expecting any of his
relation or his next of kin to =
come up and claimhis
money. Unfortunately from the day of his death till=

the time of this letter none of his relation or
friends has come up fo=
r the claim. The banking and
financial law of Citizens Trust Bank Plc's =
stipulates
that if such fund remained unclaimed after a period
offour (=
5) it will be transferred into the bank
treasury as unclaimed
bill.
On=
 this discovery sir/Madam, I and two other senior staffs
now decided do=0D
=
business with you and release the money to you as the
next of kin to Ali=
 B. Ashraf for safety and subsequent
disbursement. I will soon proceed f=
or my retirement
leave this year, and I personally do not want this
fun=
d to be transferred into the bank treasury as
unclaimed bill.That is why=
 I wanted the fund to be
move out of the bank before I proceed on my ret=
irement
from the banking services by December 15th 2004.
The need for a=
 foreigner as next of kin in this
project is occasioned by the fact that=
 the customer
Mr. Ali Ashraf was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot
stan=
d as his next of kin or heir. We have agreed that
20% of the Fund would =
be for you as foreign
partner;thereafter my colleague and I will visit y=
our
country for disbursement
according to the percentages indicated.=0D
=
To enable the immediate transfer of the fund into
yournominated account,=
 you will first apply to the
bank as the next of kin of the deceased.=0D
=
Indicating your bank account number and location 
wherein the money will=
 be remitted. Upon receipt of
your acknowledgement indicating your
inte=
rest, I will send to you the text of the
application that youwill send t=
o the Citizens Trust
Bank authority for an approval to submit your claim=
s.

Indicates your direct Fax and telephone numbers for
effective
com=
munication that this transaction needs.Please note that
you are not to a=
ppear in person, as every thing
regarding this project will be strictly =
on
documentations and every banking documents needed for
this transacti=
on will be taken care of.
Looking forward to urgently hearing from you.=0D
