Dear Friend,


I am Barrister Anthony Njaba, a solicitor at law. i am the personal 
attorney to Mr. Andrew Dekelver, a national of your country, who used to 
work with shell development company in Nigeria. On the 16th of march 
2001, my client, his wife and their only son were involved in a car 
accident along lagos-ibadan express road,all occupants of the vehicle 
unfortunately lost their lives. 


Since then i have made several enquiries to your embassy here to locate 
any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved 
unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, i decided to contact 
you,hoping that you will be willing to assist me in recovering the fund 
valued at us$9.6 million left behind by my client before it gets 
confisicated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge amount was 
deposited.The said bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin 
or have the account confisicated within the next twenty one official 
working days.Since i have been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for 
over 2 years now, i seek your consent to present you as the next of kin 
to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account can be paid to 
you.


Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we shall then discuss 
on how we can share the funds when it gets into your account. i will 
give you necessary information and some documents you need to back up 
your claim. I need your sincere and honest cooperation to enable us see 
this transaction through.i assure you that this transaction will be 
executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach 
of the law. if you wish to assist me, then you should reply.


Remember to email me your telephone and fax number and your contact 
address.please reply to my private email address: tonynjaba2k2@centrum.cz
						  	

Best Wishes,

Barrister Anthony Njaba
