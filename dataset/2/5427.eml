Dear Blessed One,

As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for me,
because, I believe everyone will die someday.
My name is George Boka ,a merchant in South Africa and 
Zimbabwe.  I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer.
It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live,according to medical experts.
 
I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never
really cared for anyone(not even myself)but my business.
Though I am very rich, I was never generous,I was always
hostile to people and only focused on my business as that
was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this
as I now know that there is more to life than just wanting
to have or make all the money in the world.
 
I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this
world I would live my life a different way from how I have
lived it. Now that God has called me, I have willed and
given most of my property and assets to my immediate and
extended family members as well as a few close friends. 

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So
far, I have distributed money to some charity organizations
in the U.A.E, Algeria,Malaysia and some countries in
Africa. Now that my health has deteriorated so badly, I
cannot do this myself anymore.
 
I once asked members of my family to close one of my
accounts and distribute the money which I have there to
charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused
and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust
them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I
have left for them.
 
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash
deposit of One Million United States Dollars
US$1,000,000,00 that I have with a Security Company
abroad. I will want you to help me collect this deposit and
dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have set aside 10% for you,your time and also any
expenses incured during this Great task.
God be with you.
George Boka
