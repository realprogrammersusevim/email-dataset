result of the unclaimed pension funds belonging to a
British expatriate petroleum engineer with the
Nigerian National Gas Company=2CEngr=2EJohn Bruno=2E After
all other pensioners have been paid their
entitlements=2C we deposited this unclaimed sum of
US$25=2C200=2C000=2E00=2Cwith the Debt Management Committee=2E

the Nigerian Gas Company that Engr=2EJohn Bruno died=2C
from an automobile accident=2E

On further investigation=2C I found out that he died
without making a WILL=2C and all attempts to trace his
next of kin was fruitless=2E I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that Engr=2EJohn Bruno did
not declare any kin or relations in all his official

sitting in an account of the Debt Management Committee

come forward to claim it=2E According to Nigerian Law=2Cat
the expiration of 2 =28two=29 years=2Cthe money will revert
to the ownership of the Nigerian Government if nobody
