>From the desk of; 
prince godwin Chambers {Solicitor & Advocate]
Falomo Shopping complex, Lagos.
I am Barrister prince  godwin , a solicitor at law. I am 
the personal attorney to Mr.Morie Curtis , a national of
your country,possibly could be your brother, who used
to work with shell Development Company in Nigeria. 
Here in after shall be referred to as my client. On
the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife and their
two Children were involved in a plane crash in a
remote village called Kuru near Jos in Plateau State.
All occupants of the plane unfortunately lost their
lives. 
Since then I have made several enquiries to your 
embassy here in lagos to locate any of my clients
extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. 
After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided
to track his last name over the Internet, to locate
any member of his family hence I contacted you. I
have contacted you to assist in repatriating the
money and property left behind by my client before
they get confiscated, frozen or declared unserviceable
by the bank where these huge deposits were lodged. 
Particularly, the Eco Bank International where the
deceased had an account valued at about Eighteen million 
United States Dollars (US$18,000,000.00). The
management has issued me a notice to provide the next
of kin or have the account frozen within the next ten 
official working days. Since I have been unsuccessful
in locating the relatives for over 2 years now I seek
your consent to present you as the next of kin of the
deceased since you have the same last name so that the
proceeds of this account valued at $18,000,000:00 can
be paid to you and then you and me can share the
money. 60% to me and 40% to you I have all the
necessary legal documents that can be used to back up
any claim we may make.
And this I must do to make sure that this fund is not
wasted or end up in the wrong hands. All I require is
your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal
through. I guarantee that this will be executed under
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from
any breach of the law. 
Please do get in touch with me through this mail box princegodwin2006@yah=
