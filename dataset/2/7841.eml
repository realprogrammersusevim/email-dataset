Dear Sir/Madam

At this perceived confusion or stress may have With due respect. Sorry re=
ceiving
this letter Since we have not known ourselves or met before.  Despite tha=
t,
I am constrained to write you this letter because of
the urgency of it. 

By way of self introduction, I am Mrs Joy Afolabi, the wife of late Dr.
Sunday Afolabi Little did I know that my Late husband used his position
in the present government to influence the  Nigerian government to award
SAGEM S.A COMPANY (FRANCE)  the contract of handing the Nigerian national=

identification card scheme in Nigeria of, which he and his colleagues wer=
e
then offered the sum of $214 million dollars by SAGEM as bribes.

Since my husband was a care-free person, he was poisoned by his colleague=
s
so that he will not get his share of the deal and later died out of shock=

during his treatment abroad in Germany when he Finlay realised that his
case was as a result of poison, but thank God, my husband was smart enoug=
h
to have kept some wealth without letting anybody knows about it.


However, since after my husband death, we have suffered maltreatment and
untold hardship in the hands of my late husband's family, simply because
I did not bear a male child [heir apparent] for my
late husband. By tradition, all that my late husband had, [wealth] belong=
s
to his brothers/family. And myself is to be remarried by his immediate yo=
unger
brother which I vehemently refused. They have taken
all that I suffered with my husband to acquire including treasures, house=
s
and his bank particular seized by them. I wanted to escape to the United
States of America [USA} with my children on exile, but
again they conspired and stole my International passport and  other trave=
lling
document to further frustrate me. My three daughters and I are trapped in=

obnoxious custom and traditional norms.
 
Thank God, two weeks ago, I received Key Text Code from a Security Compan=
y
in EUROPE, that my late husband deposited U.S $15.5 Million cash in one
Security company in Europe. It has therefore become
very necessary and urgent to contact someone a foreigner like you to help=

me receive/secure these funds overseas in a  reliable bank Account presum=
ably
an empty Bank Account, if available and  to help invest it on our behalf
as well, while we find a way of getting out to meet with you in your coun=
try.
These funds are kept with one Security Company in EUROPE to avoid detecti=
on,
seizure or diversion.
 
I have had several communication with  the Director of the security compa=
ny
in Europe, who has express willingness to help me on meeting the company'=
s
demands.

This is why I have contacted you to help save my children and I By receiv=
ing
these funds on our behalf. But you need to give me Sufficient assurance
that you will not divert the fund if you help me. 
 
My children and I have resolved to give you 30% of the total sum. This is=

all my children and I have got to live on. 
 
Please, I have reposed my confidence in you and hope you will not disappo=
int
me. I look forward to your urgent response, including your phone/ mobile
No and also your fax no for easier communication.
The secret codes (e.g Pin No, Secret Access Code)for this fund are safely=

kept with me which I can give you as soon as you express desire to help
me.

Thank in advance for confidentiality and I look forward to hearing from
you.

Mrs. Joy Afolabi.
