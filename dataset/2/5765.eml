Thank you for giving me your time,it is of great importance for you to =20
take care and understand every word which I have written down below; =20
please be patient and read my email.

I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group Plc here in Hong Kong attached in =20
Private Banking Services. I am contacting you concerning a customer =20
and an investment placed under our banks management; as a matter of =20
fact it was 3 years ago. I would respectfully request that you keep =20
the contents of this mail private and also to kindly respect the =20
integrity of the information you come by as a result of this email.I =20
contacted you independently of our investigation and no one is =20
informed of this communication; I would like to intimate you with =20
certain facts that I believe would be of interest to you.

In 2000, the subject matter; Ref: FI/TSB/957/048/0532 came to our bank =20
to engage in business discussions with our Private Banking Services =20
Department. He informed us that he had a financial portfolio of 11.37 =20
million United States Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over =20
(invest) on his behalf. I was the officer assigned to his case; I made =20
numerous suggestions in line with my duties as the de-facto chief =20
operations officer of the Private Banking Services Department, =20
especially given the volume of funds he wished to put into our bank. =20
We met on numerous occasions prior to any investments being placed, =20
and however I encouraged him to consider various growth funds with =20
prime ratings. The favored route in my advice to customers is to start =20
by assessing data on 600 traditional stocks and bond managers and 200 =20
managers of alternative investments. Based on my advice, we spun the =20
money around various opportunities and made attractive margins for our =20
first months of operation, the accrued profit with interest included, =20
stood at this point at over 13.2 million United States Dollars, this =20
margin was not the full potential of the fund but he desired low risk =20
guaranteed returns on investments. In mid 2001, he asked that the =20
money be liquidated because he needed to make an urgent investment =20
requiring cash payments in Europe. He directed that I liquidate the =20
funds and had it deposited with a firm in Europe.I informed him that =20
our bank would have to make special arrangements to have this done and =20
in order not to circumvent due process, the bank would have to make a =20
9.5 % deduction from the funds to cater for banking and statutory =20
charges. He complained about the charges but later came around when I =20
explained to him the complexities of the task he was asking of us. =20
Cash movement across borders has become especially strict since the =20
incidents of 9/11.

I contacted my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in =20
mainland Europe, I undertook all the processes and made sure I =20
followed his precise instructions to the letter and had the funds =20
deposited in a security consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist =20
private firm that accepts deposits from high net worth individuals and =20
blue chip corporations that handle valuable products or undertake =20
transactions that need immediate access to cash. This small and highly =20
private organization is familiar especially to the highly placed and =20
well-connected organizations. In line with instructions, the money was =20
deposited; he told me he wanted the money there in anticipation of his =20
arrival from Norway later that week. This was the last communication =20
we had, this transpired around February 25th 2002. In June last year, =20
we got a call from the security firm informing us of the inactivity of =20
that particular portfolio. This was an astounding position as far as I =20
was concerned, given the fact that I managed the private banking =20
sector I was the only one who knew about the deposit, and I could not =20
understand why he had not come forward to claim his deposit.I made =20
futile efforts to locate him I immediately passed the task of locating =20
him to the internal investigations department of our bank. Four days =20
later, information started to trickle in, that he was apparently dead, =20
a person who suited his description was declared dead of a heart =20
attack in Cannes, South of France; we were soon enough able to gather =20
more information and the cause of death was confirmed. The bank =20
immediately launched an investigation into possible surviving next of =20
kin to alert about the situation and also to come forward to claim his =20
estate. If you are familiar with private banking affairs, those who =20
patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some levels =20
of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, he =20
listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an =20
account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are =20
rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make the =20
accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors of =20
having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensuring =20
that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do they =20
nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not =20
nominating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our =20
care, in this case; he died in testate.

In line with our internal processes for account holders who have =20
passed away, we instituted our own investigations in good faith to =20
determine who should have right to claim the estate, this =20
investigation for several months were futile. We have scanned every =20
continent and used our private investigation affiliate companies to =20
get to the root of the problem. It is this investigation that resulted =20
in my decision to obtain your contact details and contact you, being =20
as a foreigner or rather non-Asian, as a potential benefactor of the =20
estate even if you are in no way affiliated with this individual (the =20
deceased).My official capacity dictates that I am the only party to =20
supervise the investigation and the only party to receive the results =20
of the investigation. What this means, with you being a foreigner, I =20
have considered the fact that our dear late fellow died with no known =20
or identifiable family member.

This leaves me as the only person with the full picture of what the =20
prevailing situation is in relation to the deposit and the late =20
beneficiary of the deposit. According to practice, the firm will by =20
the end of this financial year broadcast a request for statements of =20
claim to our bank, failing to receive viable claims they will most =20
probably revert the deposit back to our bank. This will result in the =20
money entering our bank's accounting system and the portfolio will be =20
out of my hands and out of the Private Banking Services Department. =20
This will not happen if I have my way.

What I wish to relate to you might be a smack of unethical practice =20
but I want you to understand something; it is only an outsider to the =20
banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking world =20
aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught with =20
huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and oversee certain =20
portfolios; you should have begun by now to put together the general =20
direction of what I propose. There is USD$ 11,991,674 deposited, I =20
alone have the deposit details and they will release the deposit to no =20
one unless I instruct them to do so.I alone know of the existence of =20
this deposit for as far as the finance firm is concerned, the =20
transaction with our deceased customer concluded when I sent the funds =20
to the firm, all outstanding interactions in relation to the file are =20
just customer services and due process. The finance firm has no single =20
idea of what's the history or nature of the deposit, they are simply =20
awaiting instructions to release the deposit to any party that comes =20
forward, and this is the situation.

This bank has spent great amounts of money trying to track the family =20
of the deceased; they have investigated for months and have found no =20
family but however the investigation has come to an end. My proposal; =20
I am prepared to place you in a position to instruct the finance firm =20
to release the deposit to you as the closest surviving relation. Upon =20
receipt of the deposit, I am prepared to share the money with you in =20
half and no more; that is: I will simply nominate you as the next of =20
kin and have them release the deposit to you; afterwards we share the =20
proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahead to ask the funds be released to =20
me, but that would have drawn a straight line to me and my involvement =20
in claiming the deposit, but on the other hand, you as a indifferent =20
foreigner would easily pass as the beneficiary with the rights to =20
claim, I assure you that I could have the deposit released to you in a =20
few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing of the =20
file relating to the customer, I will then officially communicate with =20
the finance company and instruct them to release the deposit to you; =20
with these two things: all is done. The alternative would be for us to =20
have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you as account =20
holder, this way there will be no need for you to think of receiving =20
the money from the firm.

We can fine-tune this based on our interactions, I am aware of the =20
consequences of this proposal and I ask that if you find no interest =20
in this project that you should discard this mail. I ask also, that =20
you do not be vindictive or destructive, if my offer is of no appeal =20
to you, delete this message and forget I ever contacted you; please =20
not destroy my career because you do not approve of my proposal. You =20
may not know this but people like me who have made tidy sums out of =20
comparable situations run the whole private banking sector, I am not a =20
criminal and what I do, I do not find against good conscience, this =20
may be hard for you to understand, but the dynamics of my industry =20
dictates that I make this move. Such opportunities only come ones' way =20
once in a lifetime. I cannot let this chance pass me by and I hope you =20
understand, because for once I found myself in total control and face =20
to face with my destiny.

These chances won't pass me by, I ask that you do not destroy my =20
chance, if you will not work with me please let me know, and hence =20
move on with my life, but do not destroy me; I am a family man and =20
this is an occasion to provide them with new opportunities. There is a =20
reward for this project and it is a task well worth undertaking, I =20
have evaluated the risks and the only risk I have here is from you =20
refusing to work with me and alerting my bank; I am the only one who =20
knows of this situation, good fortune will bless you and plant you =20
into the center of relevance in my life, let=92s share the blessing.

If you find yourself interested to work with me, please contact me =20
specifically, through this email account (mr.qin_wang@emanssv.com), if =20
you give me positive signals, I will initiate this process towards a =20
conclusion. It is necessary to inform you that under no condition =20
should you contact me via official channels; I will simply deny =20
knowing you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you =20
contacting me through our official lines neither do I want you =20
contacting me through my official email account. Contact me only =20
through this email address above; I do not want any direct link =20
between you and me.My official lines are not secure lines as they are =20
periodically monitored to assess our level of customer care in line =20
with our Total Quality Management policy, please observe this =20
instruction religiously.

Please, again, note I am a family man; I happily married with two =20
kids, I send you this mail not without a measure of fear as to what =20
the consequences might be, but I know within me that nothing ventured =20
is nothing gained and that success and riches never come easy or on a =20
platter of gold, this is the one truth I have learned from my private =20
banking clients; do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one =20
accord, I shall have the pleasure of meeting you after this task has =20
been completed plan a meeting, soon.

I await your response.

Yours Sincerely,

Qin.
