Dear Sir, 

I am Mr Steve Ibeto, the personal accounting officer to 
Mr Williams Hales, a national of your country, who 
used to work with shell development company in 
Nigeria. Here in after shall be referred to as my 
client. 

On the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife And 
their three children were involved in a car accident 
along sagbama express road. All occupants of the 
vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I 
have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate 
any of my clients extended relatives this has also 
proved unsuccessful. 

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided 
to trace any of his relation but to all avail.After investigation,i disc=
overed that his next of kin dead along with him during the accident Hence=
 i have contacted you to act as his next of kin to assist in repartrating=
 the money and property left behind by my client before they get confisic=
ated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this huge deposits were =
lodged. 

Particularly,the Zenith International bank plc where the deceased had 
an account valued at about 5.5million dollars has 
issued me a notice as his accounting officer to 
provide the next of kin or have the account 
confisicated within the next ten official working 
days. 


since i have been unsuccesfull in locating the 
relatives for over 2 years now i seek your consent to 
present you as the next of kin of the deceased since 
you have the same surname so that the proceeds of this 
account valued at 5.5million dollars can be paid to 
you and then you and me can share the money. I have 
all necessary legal documents that can be used to back 
up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest 
cooperation to enable us see this deal through. I 
guarantee that this will be executed under a 
legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any 
breach of the law. 

Thanks and God Bless 

Best Regards. 

Mr Steve Ibeto.
