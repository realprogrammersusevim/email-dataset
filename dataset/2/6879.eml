DR. WILLIAMS BANIGO
FEDERAL SECRETARIAT,
LAGOS, NIGERIA


             URGENT   &   CONFIDENTIAL
Best wishes of good health and success in your pursuits particularly
through my proposal as contained in this letter.Before going into details 
of my proposal to you, I must first solicit you to treat it with  utmost
confidentiality, as this is required for its success.

My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of
Nigerias Contracts Review Panel who are interested in diverting some
funds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Central Bank of
Nigeria.In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your
assistance to enable us transfer into your account the said floating
funds. We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this
financial quarter.

The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime,
government officials awarded contracts that were grossly over-invoiced to 
Contractors.The present civilian government set up the Contract Review
Panel, which has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made
available to it by the decree setting up the panel,  to review these
contracts and if necessary pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.

My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds which 
are presently floating in the Central Bank of Nigeria ready for
disbursement and would like to divert some of it for our own purposes.
However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and  members of
this panel,we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of
companies that are based in Nigeria. I have therefore been mandated, as a 
matter of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable
overseas partner into whose account we can transfer the sum of
U.S.$16,500,000.00(sixteen Million,five hundred  thousand U.S. Dollars).
That is why I am writing you this letter.

We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into your account,
if you agree with our proposition as follows;

(i) 10% to the account owner (you).

(ii) 80% for us (the panel officials).

(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both you and us
)incidental to the actualisation of this project.

We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign
stock markets and other business till we are ready and able to have
access to them. Please note that this transactionis 100% safe and
risk-free.We intend to effect the transfer within a few days from the
date of receipt of the following information:

Your name, companys name, address and telephone and fax numbers, and
your banking information. The above information will enable us write
letters of claim andjob description respectively. This way, we will use
your companys name to apply for the payment and backdate the  award of
the contract to your company.

We are looking forward to doing this transaction with you and we solicit
for your utmost confidentiality in this transaction. Please acknowledge
the receipt of this letter and, I will bring you into a more detailed
picture of this transaction when I hear from you.

Best regards,
Dr. Williams Banigo
