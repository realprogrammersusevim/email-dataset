MY DEAR ,

I AM THE MANAGER OF BILL AND EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT 
OF BANK OF AFRICA . I SAW YOUR CONTACTS IN INTERNET SEARCH,AFTER MUCH 
CONSIDERATION I DECIDED TO WRITE YOU SINCE I CANNOT BE ABLE TO SEE YOU FACE 
TO FACE AT FIRST. I WILL LIKE YOU TO TAKE YOUR TIME TO READ THIS MAIL 
CAREFULLY. I DID NOT MEAN TO EMBARRASSE YOU WITH MY BUSINESS PROPOSAL BUT I 
SERIOUSLY NEED YOUR ASSISTANCE. PLEASE THIS IS A CONFIDENTIAL MATTER AND IT
REQUIRES URGENCY.

IN MY DEPARTMENT WE DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF U.S$12.5M DOLLARS (TWELVE 
MILLION FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND USD) IN AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGS TO ONE OF OUR 
FOREIGN CUSTOMER WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY ON MONDAY,31 
JULY,2000, IN A PLANE CRASH SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE 
HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS OR HER NEXT OF KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY 
BECAUSE WE CAN NOT RELEASE IT UNLESS SOME BODY APPLIES FOR IT AS NEXT OF KIN 
OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN OUR BANKING GUIDLINES AND LAWS, 
BUT UNFORTUNATELY WE LEARNT THAT HIS SUPPOSED NEXT OF KIN DIED ALONGSIDE 
WITH HIM AT THE PLANE CRASH LEAVING NOBODY BEHIND FOR THE CLAIM. IT IS 
THEREFORE UPON THIS DISCOVERY, I NOW DECIDED TO MAKE THIS BUSINESS PROPOSAL 
TO YOU AND TO RELEASE THE MONEY TO YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE 
DECEASED FOR SAFETY AND SUBSEQUENT DISBURSEMENT SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR 
IT AND I DON'T WANT THIS MONEY TO GO INTO THE BANK TREASURY AS UNCLAIMED 
BILL.

THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDLINE HERE STIPULATES THAT IF SUCH MONEY 
REMAINEDUNCLAIMED AFTER SEVEN YEARS, THE MONEY WILL BE TRANFERED INTO THE 
BANK AS UNCLAIMED BILL.

I THEREFORE AGREE THAT 40% OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS FOREIGNER 
PARTNER, IN RESPECT TO THE PROVISION OF A FOREIGN ACCOUNT, 10% WILL BE SET 
ASIDE FOR EXPENSES INCURED DURING THE BUSINESS AND 50% WOULD BE FOR ME.THERE 
AFTER I WILL VISIT YOUR COUNTRY FOR DISBURSEMENT ACCORDING TO THE 
PERCENTAGES INDICATED.

THEREFORE, TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THIS FUND TO YOU AS ARRANGED, 
YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS RELATION OR NEXT OF KIN TO THE DECEASED 
INDICATING YOUR BANK NAME, YOUR BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER, YOUR PRIVATE TELEPHONE 
AND FAX NUMBER FOR EASY AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION AND LOCATION WHERE IN 
THE MONEY WILL BE REMITTED.

I WILL NOT FAIL TO BRING TO YOUR NOTICE THAT THIS TRANSACTION IS HITCH-FREE 
AND THAT YOU SHOULD NOT ENTERTAIN ANY ATOM OF FEAR AS ALL REQUIRED 
ARRANGEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR THE TRANSFER. YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME
IMMEDIATELY AS SOON AS YOU RECIEVE THIS LETTER.

TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU IMMEDIATELY.

YOURS FAITHFULLY,
MRS PAT BINTU
