<P>&nbsp;Thank you for giving me your time. Please be patient and rea=
d my email to you.<BR>I am a staff of Lloyds TSB Group attached in Pr=
ivate Banking Services. I am contacting you concerning a customer and=
, an investment placed under our banks management 3 years ago, I cont=
acted you independently of our investigation and no one is informed o=
f this communication and I would like to intimate you with certain fa=
cts that I believe would be of interest to you.<BR>&nbsp;In 2000, the=
 subject matter; ref: bb/tsb/bank/73 came to our bank to engage in bu=
siness discussions with our Private Banking Services Department. He i=
nformed us that he had a financial portfolio of 8.35 million United S=
tates Dollars, which he wished to have us turn over on his behalf. I =
was the officer assigned to his case; I made numerous suggestions in =
line with my duties as the de-facto chief operations officer of the P=
rivate Banking Services Department, especially given the volume of fu=
nds he wished to put into our bank. We met on numerous o
 unds to=20
cater for banking and statutory charges. He complained about the char=
ges but later came around when I explained to him the complexities of=
 the task he was asking of us. Cash movement across borders has becom=
e especially strict since the incidents of 9/11.<BR>&nbsp;I contacted=
 my affiliate in Europe and had the funds available in main land Euro=
pe. I undertook all the processes and made sure I followed his precis=
e instructions to the latter and had the funds deposited in a securit=
y consultancy firm, the firm is a specialist private firm that accept=
s deposits from high net worth individuals and blue chip corporations=
 that handle valuable products or undertake transactions that need im=
mediate access to cash. This small and highly private organization is=
 familiar especially to the highly placed and well-connected organiza=
tions. In line with instructions, the money was deposited. He told me=
 he wanted the money there in anticipation of his arrival from Norway=
 later that week. This was the last communication we had
 those wh
o patronize our services usually prefer anonymity, but also some leve=
ls of detachment from conventional processes. In his bio-data form, h=
e listed no next of kin. In the field of private banking, opening an =
account with us means no one will know of its existence, accounts are=
 rarely held under a name; depositors use numbers and codes to make t=
he accounts anonymous. This bank also gives the choice to depositors =
of having their mail sent to them or held at the bank itself, ensurin=
g that there are no traces of the account and as I said, rarely do th=
ey nominate next of kin. Private banking clients apart from not nomin=
ating next of kin also usually in most cases leave wills in our care.=
<BR>&nbsp;What I wish to relate to you will smack of unethical practi=
ce but I want you to understand something. It is only an outsider to =
the banking world who finds the internal politics of the banking worl=
d aberrational. The world of private banking especially is fraught wi=
th huge rewards for those who occupy certain offices and
 it to yo
u as the closest surviving relation. Upon receipt of the deposit, I a=
m prepared to share the money with you in half and no more. That is: =
I will simply nominate you as the next of kin and have them release t=
he deposit to you. We share the proceeds 50/50.I would have gone ahea=
d to ask the funds be released to me, but that would have drawn a str=
aight line to me and my involvement in claiming the deposit. But on t=
he other hand, would easily pass as the beneficiary solo with the rig=
hts to claim. I assure you that I could have the deposit released to =
you in a few days. I will simply inform our bank of the final closing=
 of the file relating to the customer. I will then officially communi=
cate with the finance company and instruct them to release the deposi=
t to you. With these two things: all is done. The alternative would b=
e for us to have the firm direct the funds to another bank with you a=
s account holder. This way there will be no need for you to think of =
receiving the money from the firm. We can fine-tune this
 n with m
y life but do not destroy me. I am a family man and this is an opport=
unity to provide them with new opportunities. There is a reward for t=
his project and it is a task well worth undertaking. I have evaluated=
 the risks and the only risk I have here is from you refusing to work=
 with me and alerting my bank. I am the only one who knows of this si=
tuation, good fortune has blessed you with a name that has planted yo=
u into the center of relevance in my life. Let's share the blessing. =
If you find yourself able to work with me, contact me through this em=
ail account:jamesalfred@i12.com. If you give me positive signals, I w=
ill initiate this process towards a conclusion. I wish to inform you =
that should you contact me via official channels; I will deny knowing=
 you and about this project. I repeat, I do not want you contacting m=
e through my official phone lines nor do I want you contacting me thr=
ough my official email account. Contact me only through this email ad=
