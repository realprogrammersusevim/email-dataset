  ("REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS
              CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE")

Compliment Of The Season, 

On a very good day. I am (Joe Kekabu Esq),the Head of file Department in =
African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist searc=
h.

When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability a=
nd reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God=
 or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ =
15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account=
 that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his enti=
re family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got infor=
mation about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to come ov=
er and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebody appli=
es for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our =
banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed nex=
t of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving n=
obody behind for the claim. 

 It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my depart=
ment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the m=
oney to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and=
 subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t wan=
t this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained=
 unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank tr=
easury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this=
 business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, an=
d a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 3=
0 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the p=
rovision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incure=
d during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. Th=
ere after i will visit your country for disbursement according to the per=
centages indicated. 

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arrang=
ed, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the d=
eceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private=
 telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and locati=
on where the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text o=
f the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this trans=
action is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear a=
s all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer. 

You should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon=
 as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. 
Your=92s faithfully, 

Joe Kekabu (Esq.)

POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer=
 to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As yo=
u finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss ver=
y well over this business.
