Sir,

Investment and Cooperation Opportunity.

Compliments and greetings to you. Haven found you listed
with your trade commission in our country; it is our wish
to do business with you, hence your receipt of this letter.

The purpose of this letter is to introduce ourselves to
you, we are a Middle East Business consultancy, offering
business advisor services in the region, we are not a very
big company, but when suddenly confronted with the task of
investing funds in your country exceeding our capacity we
decided to seek a partner, because we have never done
business in your country.

We are brokering an Investment deal in your country on
behalf of a client of our firm. This deal will involve the
eventual investment of USD 25 M. (Twenty Five Million
Dollars) in your country.

We are by this letter offering you our partnership, so as
to allow us have you as representative and manager of
invested funds in your country. Since we can not determine
if this email is still functional and also your willingness
we have kept this proposal brief.

If you are interested in this offer of partnership, please
respond and give us your full contact details (as preferred
for this interaction) plus company profile and in response
we will send you an elaborate proposal and details of this
offer.

Your expedient response will be appreciated.

Thank you.

El Hadji Abdul Mohamed.
Managing Partner,
HST&Associates.
