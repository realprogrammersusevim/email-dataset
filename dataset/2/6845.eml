FROM:MRS.MABEL NDLOVU
ATTN:
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me
since you don't know me personally,but for the
introduction,I am MRS. MABEL NDLOVU,the wife of
Late DR.ONOMUA ANDREW NDLOVU who was recently
murdered in the land dispute in zimbabwe.
I got your contact from the INTERNATIONAL TRADE
CENTRE here in Johhanesburg and decided to write
you.My Husband was among the few black Zimbabwe rich
famers murdered in the cold blood by the agents of
the ruling governmentof President Robert MUGABE for his
alleged support and sympathy for the Zimbabwean
opposition party,controlled by the white minority.
Before his death,he had taken me to to deposite the
sum of Five Million Dollars US$ 5M.with a security
and finance company as if he knew the looming danger in
Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as
gemstones to avoid much demurrage from the security
company. This money was earmarked for the purchase of new farm
machinery and chemicals for the establishment of our new farm in
lesotho and Swaziland.This land problem arose when president
Robert MUGABE introduced a new land act,which wholly affected
the rich white famers and some blacks vehemently condemned the
modusoperand"adopted by the government. This
resulted to rampant killings and mob actions by the war
veterans and some political thugs presently,more
than SIX-HUNDRED[600]people have so far been killed.Heads of
government from the west,especially The Great Britain and The
United states of America have voice their condemnation of
MUGABE'S plan.The South Africa development community (SADEC)has
continuously supported MUGABE'S new land reform
Act.It is against this background that I and my Children who are
currently staying as REFUGEE in a SOUTH AFRICAN REPUBLIC but
currently seeking An ASSYLUM in any of THE THE WEST AFRICAN
COUNTRIES have decided to transfer my late Husband's money into
a foreign
account. As the only and LEGITIMATE -WIFE of my late
husband I am saddled with the responsibility of seeking a
genuine foreign account where this money could be
transfer without theknowledge of my country's
government who are tatically freezing our
familieswealthback home in ZIMBABWE and The South
Africa government seems to be playing along with
them. I am faced with the delimma of investing this amount of
money in The South Africa Republic for the fear of encountering
the same experience in future since both countries have almost
the same political history.Moreso ,the South Africa Financial
foreign exchange policy does not allow such investment hence
I am seeking for Assistance.As a business person whom
I must entrust my future and that of my family on his
hands,I must let you know that this transfer is 100%
RISK FREE . Therefore if you accept to assist my family,we are
willing to offer you 20% of the total sum for your assitance,70%
for me and my family,while 10% will be mapped out for all
expenses.I would wish to invest in your country on REAL- ESTATE
based on your advice and I would also receive assurance that you
would'nt sit on this money when transfered into your personal
or company account. If this PLEA is acceptable by you please do
send me your personaldetails,Name and Address,telephone and fax numbers .
You should know that this business is highly confidential and shall
be kept within you alone.I hope to hear from you soon
on the  email address bellow.

Thanks,

Best Regards,
MRS MABEL NDLOVU.
