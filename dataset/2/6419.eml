Please do pardon me for contacting you through this
medium. I am Mrs Jocelyn Jones the Wife of late Dr. George
Alvin Jones, former minister of state for presidential
affairs in Liberia, who was recently murdered at the free
port of Monrovia by the junta rebels group, who dethrone
and drive the ex-president of my country Liberia, Charles
Taylor.
  
The perennial war in my country at that time forced me and
my son Jeffery Jones into exile in this country Cote
d&#8217;Ivoire for our safety. After the Death of my
husband, I and my son discovered among my late husband's
Documents that he has some fund deposited into a bank here
in Abidjan Cote d&#8217;Ivoire. I will appreciate if you
help me in getting this money out of here and we propose
to give you 15% of the total money for your assistance.
  
The total money is US$14.5mdollars,Please reply
immediately to enable us discuss how to go ahead with the
transaction, and for your information this message will
always be kept confidential for security reasons as you
