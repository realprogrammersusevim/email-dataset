Dear Beloveth,

I am Prince Fayad W. Bolkiah, the eldest son of Prince Jefri 
Bolkiah,former Finance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate 
on the GulfIsland.

I will save your time by not amplifying my extended royal family 
history,which  has already been disseminated by the international media 
during the controversial dispute that erupted between my father and his 
step brother,the sultan of Brunei Sheik Muda Hassanal Bolkiah.

As you may know from the international media, the sultan had accused my 
father of financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$14.8 Billion
dollars. This was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made 
my father company Amedeo Development Company and government owned 
Brunei Investment Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in 
office.

However my father was kept under house arrest, his bank accounts and 
private properties including a crude oil export refinery were later 
confiscated by the  sultanate.

Furthermore, during this unfortunate period i was advised to evacuate 
my immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution 
from the sultan and his security operatives, but before I could do that 
I 
was placed under house arrest by the Sultan and i have no access to a 
phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I am sending 
you this mail.

Before my In-castration, I went ahead to dispatch the sum of Five 
Hundred Million United States Dollars US$500 Million in cash under 
special arrangement  into the custody of different Private security and 
Trustee company s for safe keeping abroad.

The money where splitted and kept in the following countries in this 
proportion: US$50 Million is in Switzerland, US$100 Million is in 
London, 
US$100 Million is in United States, US$80 Million is in United Arab 
Emirate and the balance US$US170 Million is in Holland.

Hence I seek your good assistance to invest these funds into profitable 
investment in your country to facilitate future survival for my family 
abroad.I have decided to offer 10% of these funds to you as 
compensation for your strong cooperation.

Please I count on your absolute confidentiality, transparency and trust 
while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion 
of this  business transaction.

I remain yours sincerely 

Prince Fayad .W. Bolkiah
Brunei Darussalam.
