Dear Sir/Mandam,

I greet you in the name of GOD, the Beneficent, and the Merciful. Before I 
introduce myself, I wish to inform you that this letter is not a hoax mail 
and I urge you to treat it serious. We want to transfer fund to overseas 
account the sum of ($30,000.000.00 USD)Thirty Million United States Dollars) 
from a Bank here in Nigeria West Africa. I want to ask you, If you are 
capable to quietly provide either an existing bank account or to set up a new 
Bank account immediately to receive this fund,even an empty account can serve 
to receive this fund,as long as you will remain honest to me till the end for 
this important business,trusting in you and believing in God that you will 
never let me down either now or in future.
I am Patrick Duru,I WORK WITH FIDELITY BANK PLC During the course of our 
auditing last week, I discovered a floating fund in an account opened in the 
bank in 1997 and since 1999 till date, nobody has operated on this account 
again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that 
the owner of the account died without a beneficiary to the account hence the 
money is floating and if I do not remit this fund out urgently it will be 
forfeited for nothing.
The owner of this account is Mr. Morris Thompson of 61, of Fairbanks, Alaska 
an American and a great industrialist,business leader and largest private 
land owner resident of Fairbanks City Alaska State who unfortunately lost his 
life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed, 
including his wife(Thelma Thompson)and only daughter(Sheryl Thompson)leaving 
nobody to claim the fund.
No other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the 
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well 
that the account is a secret account. The total amount involve is Thirty 
Million United States Dollars only [$30,000.000.00]and I wish to transfer 
this fund into a safe foreigners account abroad. But I don't know any 
foreigner; I am only contacting you as a foreigner because this fund cannot 
be approved to a local person here, but to a foreigner who has information 
about the account, which I shall give to you upon your positive response. I 
am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let me down 
in this business,you are the first and the only person that I am contacting 
for this business. So, please reply urgently so that I will inform you the 
next step to take urgently.
I need your strong assurance that you will never let us down, me and a key 
bank official who is deeply involved with me in this business. I guarantee 
that this transaction will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that 
will protect you from any breach of the law. The bank official will destroy 
all documents of transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no 
trace to any place. I will use my position and influence to obtain all legal 
approvals for onward transfer of this money to your account with appropriate 
clearance from the relevant ministries and foreign exchange departments.
At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 30% of the total 
amount, 60% will be for me, while 10% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring.Furthermore, the transaction 
is Risk Free, there is no risk involved and the utmost paramount of this 
transaction is Secret and Confidential due to my 15 years of meritious 
service with the Fidelity Bank Plc.Which I dont want to  jeopardize.
Note that,all correspondence should be by phone and by e-mail,I will be 
extremely happy if you can abide to my instructions, I believe the sky shall 
be our limit and willing to invest in your area of specialization at the end 
of this transaction. Feel free to contact me directly via my email address or 
telephone.
Thanks for your anticipated co-operation
