Confidential and Urgent matter

I believe you are a busy person, please let me briefly
outline Our agenda, and then, I will proceed to give you
details.
I am Mrs. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha the Only Wife of present
Governor of Bayelsa State of Republic of Nigeria I know
that it may surprise you being emailed by a strange Woman
from African country asking for urgent assistance in an
urgent deal. The reason why I decided to involve you in
this deal is due to what my husband is  experiencing in
London at present, when he was arrested with 1 .5 millioin
pound sterling in his guest house in london recently.

Because of this terrible experience I decided that morning
about the money (USD$120Millions) left behind here in state
house,I was afraid of putting the fund in the Bank, because
I have to give account to the bank on how I got the money.
I then packaged the fund in consignments and deposited the
consignments with a security/courier company. I did not
want the management of the Security Company to know the
content of the consignments, therefore I registered the
content of the consignments as Gold Bars. Now, the security
company believes that  what I deposited with them was Gold
Bars.
I have notified the Security Company where I deposited the
consignments that contained the fund, that I am moving the
consignment abroad and the security company has since been
waiting for my authority for the consignment to leave my
country and move to abroad.
 If you know that you handle .receive such big funds
honestly and wisely , then do contact me back first through
this my email:  Mrs.DiepreyeAlamieyeseigha@hotmail.com
We have set assude 20% percentage of the cash will be
your's after you receive the consignment/funds. Then you
will open an account in your country with my name and
deposit our 80% percentage of the cash.I want to inform you
that if you are able to receive this money your percentage
will increase after subsequent deals if you prove your
reliability in this deal Please don't involve a third party
in this deal because of the nature of the deal and also as
a public figure my husband may be implicated by the third
person And don't dispose any document of this deal to any
body except when we ask you to do so, Note that this
transaction involves no risk whatsoever for you will have
NO dealing with my country Nigeria goverment Rather, you
will deal directly with the security courier company . 
 Let me have your confidential Details YOUR FULL
NAME,PHYSICAL MAILING ADDRESS,PHONE AND FAX NUMBER (Which i
will give to the company to ship the consignment to you
immediately) in your response to this proposal   .
This matter should be treated as urgent and confidential as
possible please
Best regards
Mrs. Diepreye Alamieyeseigha
First Lady 
Bayelsa State ,Nigeria
