Dearly Beloved In Christ,


Calvary greetings in the name of our Lord Jesus
Christ, I am former Mrs. Fatima Adijat Alade, now Mrs.
Mary Abosede Alade, a widow to Late Sherrif Alade. I
am 70years old. I am now a new Christian
convert,suffering from long time cancer of the breast.


>From all indications, my condition is serious and is
quite obvious that I may not live more than six
months,because the cancer stage has gotten to a very
severe state and my doctor has told me this. My late
husband was killed during the Gulf war, and during the
period of our marriage we had a son who was also
killed in cold blood during the Gulf war. 


My late husband was very wealthy and after his death,I
inherited all his business and wealth. As my doctor
told me that I may not live for more than six months,I
am so scared about this. So, I now decided to divide
part of the inherited wealth, by contributing to the
development of evangelism in part of the world. 
This mission which will no doubt be tasking had made
me to recently relocated to Nigeria, Africa where I
live presently. I selected your ministry after
visiting the website for this purpose and prayed over
it, I am willing to donate the sum of
US$10.000,000.00(Ten Million USD)to your Ministry for
the development of evangelism and also as aids for the
less privileged around you. 


Please note that, this fund is lying with a Security
Company and my family lawyer will file an immediate
application for the transfer of the money in the name
of your ministry. 


If you are interested,do contact our Lawyer on the email address below,his name is Barrister FRANK OSAROBO:


email: frankosarobo@email.ro


Please, do not reply me if you have
the intention of using this fund for personal use.


Lastly, I want your ministry to keep praying for me as
regarding my health because I have come to find out
since my spiritual birth recently that wealth
acquisition without Jesus Christ in one's life is
vanity upon vanity. If you have to die says the
Lord,keep fit and I will give you the crown of life. 


May the Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, the love of
God, and the sweet fellowship of the Holy Spirit be
with you now and forevermore.


We await your urgent reply. 


Yours in Christ,


Mrs Mary A. Alade
No.1 Sherrif Alade Close
