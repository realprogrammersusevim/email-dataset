Good day,
Hope you are doing very great? Getting your contact was not
an easy task since my client ordered me to seek a partner
very far away and I went to the institute of International
Business to apply and I paid them the charges.
I Barrister Miroslav Vlado, representing Mr. Mikhail
Khodorkovsky (M.k.) of Russia. He is one time the richest
man in Russia and the head of YUKO'S OIL till that
unfaithful day that they got him arrested and since then
all his accounts and known businesses have been
confiscated.
I would like to ask for your partnership in re-profiling
funds over US$423 million. I will give the details, but in
summary, the funds are coming via bank transfer. Please
note that as an attorney I want a very straight forward and
God fearing person, as this is a legitimate transaction and
not a Childs play. You will be paid 10% for your
"management fees".
You can log into this website to find out more about my
client: <<http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/3213505.stm>>

if you are interested, please write back and I will provide
further instructions. Keep this confidential as you could
also reach me on "mv_atexfirm7@yahoo.com"
Finally, please note that this must be concluded next week.
I look forward to it.
Regards,
Miroslav Vlado.
(Barrister and Solicitors Esq.)
