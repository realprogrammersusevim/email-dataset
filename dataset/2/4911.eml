Dear Friend,

My name is Mr Solomon Adjei, I work in executive capacity with TRUST SECU=
RITY
COMPANY (ltd) Accra Ghana. I joined the services of this company in 1991.=

I got the information concerning you and your company from our Chamber of=

Commerce here and after due consultation, I decided to contact you believ=
ing
that by the grace of God that you will be my partner in this business.

I have worked with this company for over 12 years, within this period of
time I watched with meticulous precision onhow African Head of State and
government functionarieshave been moving huge sums of money (Dollars, Pou=
ndSterling,
French Franc, Cash)with the aid of their foreign partners abroad. They br=
ing
in these consignment of money cash and secretly declare the content as je=
welries,
Gold, Precious Stones, Family Treasure, Documents,etc. Mobutu Sese Seko
of Zaire, Fodey Sankoy of Sierra Leone, Felix Houphet Buigny of Ivory Coa=
st,
Konnan Bede of Ivory Coast, etc.

These people have at one time or the other deposited consignments with us=

and their foreign partners, relatives and Next of Kin are Claiming most
of these consignment and a lot more are laying here unclaimed for as much=

as 7 years, as no available information to anybody except the depositors,=

and most of them are dead. Since the inception of the year 2003, TRUST SE=
CURITY
COMPANY LTD Management changed the procedure of claiming of consignments.=


As soon as you are able to produce all the secret information as containe=
d
in the secret file of the company as regard the consignment, it will be
released to you upon demand. From our records, more than 10 consignments
belonging to these people has been claimed in the past six months and thi=
s
is why I am seeking for your co-operation and assistance.

Mr. Martin Greenberg was an American,he worked with one of the top minist=
ers
of President Robert Mugabe who was in charge of the campaigning for re-el=
ecting
Mr. Mugabe into office in their last election. He deposited this consignm=
ent
containing 35.5 million United State Dollars ($35.5m USD)early in 1999,
this money according to him was to be used for further political programm=
es.
He died in the plane crash of 31 October 1999 with the Wife (on the Egypt=
ian
990) with reports on CNN as you can verify via the CNN website as state
below:(http://www.cnn.com/us/9911/02/egyptair990.list/index.html)  He die=
d
alongside with other passengers aboard without leaving any relations as
his wife died as well in the same plane crash.
 
Since his death, no one knows about this transaction with TRUST SECURITY
COMPANY ltd except me who acted
as company attorney when he deposited the consignment. I have finished ev=
ery
arrangement for you to come and claim the consignment as the next of Kin
Mr.MARTIN GREENBERG. The procedure is very simple: - Apply officially to
the Director of operation Trust security company Ltd Accra - Ghana, for
the release of consignment No.TSC/15031964. They will demand for some doc=
uments
and the security code of the consignment, you will call on me to supply
you with every detailed Information as regard the consignment.

As soon as they have confirmed it to be correct, the company will invite
you for the collection. Nobody will ever know that I am involved in the
deal, I suggest upon conclusion, we share it on the Ratio of 50%-40%and
10% will go for humanitarian service ie, motherless babies home, more als=
o
you will make an arrangement on investments that I will invest my money
in your country.

I assure you that this business is very secure and risk free. Plese, if
you are interested on this proposal, kindly let me know to ebable me know=

my stand  and hope on you. you are advise to contact me through my teleph=
one
nuber: 233-244-514-523 for an oral clarification and detailings.

Thanks

Mr Solomon Adjei
