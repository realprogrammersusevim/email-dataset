I am contacting you in the belief that you are a honest and trustworthy person=2EI hope you will not betray the confidence I have in you to have contacted you even though we've not met before=2EBesides=2CI only got your address from an internet listing=2EI am Dr=2EDonald Ike=2CHead of Banking Operations=2CEastern Banking Unit of one of the biggest banks in Africa=2EI will not mention the name of the bank I work for security reasons but promise to disclose it to you as soon as I am convinced that you are capable and willing to assist me with this transaction=2EI hope this does not turn you off anyway=3BI am only being cautious=2E

The account numbers mentioned above belong to late Engr=2EPhilip De Wulf=2Ca Belgian who was the managing director of Energy Services International ESI=2Ca petrol and oil servicing company =2EThis company has been a household name in the downstream s-ector of my country for its professional 
service provision especially in the late 80s but after the death of Engr=2EWulf everything began to take a rather retrogressive trend largely due to the inefficiency of his successor=2E

I personally manage the accounts of this company as well as the personal account of Engr=2EP=2ED=2EWulf
=2EShortly before his death in a ghastly motor accident which claimed his life and that of his newly married wife Mrs=2EDebra Wulf in 1993=2CI had received some receivables in the form of cheque payment on behalf of my esteemed customer=2CEngr=2EWulf and since he instructed that all personal 
cheques be paid to his online account=2CI followed the instruction to the latter=2EHowever as a result of his death=2Cthis account remained unserviced for a long time neither was there any person named next of kin =2E

The net balance of this account till date is One Hundred and Forty Eight Million=2CNine Hundred and Forty Eight Thousand=2CFive Hundred United States Dollars=28$148=2C948=2C500=2E00=29=2EAccording to the Banking and Other Financial Act 1991 =28as amended=29 of my country if such deposit is not claimed twelve years after the demise of the account holder=2Cthe Board of Directors should recommend to the Federal Authorites that efforts were actually made to establish the next - of -kin but due to non was specified by the deceased=2Cthat the Federal Government should inherit the account=2EThe 
actual fact on ground is that the directors do not return such money to the Fedeal 
Authorities=2Cinstead they share and stach it in their foreign accounts amongst themselves=2EThis should go far to explain why the bank is not making any effort in trying to locate any relation of this man for about a decade now but individual investigation conducted by myself shows that there is no information about his relations mentioned in any of the account opening documents filed at the bank=2E

All I want you to do is to collaborate with me by standing in as the beneficiary because Management is ready to approve the remittance of the money to any foreigner who has correct information of this account=2EBeside I would use my position to facilitate prompt remittance of the

Bank information immediately if you are interested=2E As soon as I get this information and I am convinced that you are capable to do this transaction=2CI will consult a probate lawyer on your behalf as the beneficiary for the drafting and notarization of the will and to obtain the neccesary documents and letter of Probate=2FAdministration in your favour so as to put you in better position as the beneficiary =2EPlease you have to be eraborate in your profile to enable 
me make a good assessment about your desirability=2EI shall tell you the name of my bank soon after I am convinced of your personality=2E

curtail the excesses of the directors and secondly to plan ahead of my retirement which is just few months from now=2EIn view of this=2Cyou may be approached after the transfer to provide me with investment advice as I plan to invest the fund in any lucrative venture after retirement=2E
