Office of Auditor General,
CITIBANK,
364 Kensington High St
London W14 
8NS

Dear Friend,

I am Dr. Robin Quest the Chief auditor general of 
CITIBANK 364 Kensington High St London W14 8NS. I have urgent and very 
confidential business proposition for you. On May 20, 1999, an Iraqi 
Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the BRITISH PETROLUEM 
CORPORATION Mr. Dara Baraz. Made a numbered time (Fixed deposit) for 24 
calendar months, valued at US$32,200,000.00 (Thirty two Million two 
hundred thousand dollars only) in this bank. Upon maturity in 2001, I 
sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no 
reply. 

After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered 
from his contract employers, the British petroleum corporation that Mr. 
Dara Baraz died as a result of torture in the hand of Sadam Hussein 
during one of his trips to his country Iraq. On further investigation, 
I found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to 
trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made further 
investigation and discovered that mr Dara Baraz did not declare any kin 
or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit 
paperwork in my Bank.

This sum of US$32,200,000.00 has been floating 
as unclaimed since 1999 in my bank as all efforts to get his relatives 
have hit the stones. According to the British law at the expiration of 
6 (six) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the British 
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund and the six years is the 
end of September 2005 Consequently, my proposal is that i want to seek 
your consent as a foreigner to stand in as the owner of the money as 
the next of kin to the deceased so that the bank will transfer the 
money to your desi gnated account. All documents and proves to enable 
you get this fund will be carefully worked out. I have secured from the 
probate an order of mandamus to locate any of the deceased 
beneficiaries, and more so I are assuring you that the business is 
risk 
free involvement. 

Your share stays while the rest be for me and 
for investment purpose as I will leave London by the end of the year. 
The sharing of the funds will be based According to agreement within 
you and me. As soon as i receive an acknowledgement of receipt of this 
message in acceptance of our mutual business proposal, I will furnish 
you with the necessary modalities and disbursement ratio to suit both 
parties without any conflict. If this proposal is acceptable by you, do 
not take undue advantage of the trust i have bestowed in you.

PLEASE, 
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT DOING BUSINESS OVER THE INTERNET IS RISK. 
ENDEAVOR TO SEND YOUR CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER IN
YOUR 
REPLY TO THIS BUSINESS TRANSACTION.

Regards.
Dr. Robin Quest
Auditor 
Citibank London
