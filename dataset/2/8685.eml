Hello, 

My name is Martin Mccourt, an Irish national,though I have lived all in Portugal. 
I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer .It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right 
now I have only about a few months to live, according to medical experts. 

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for 
anyone(not even myself)but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never 
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business 
as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now 
know that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money 
in the world. I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this 
world I would live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now 
that God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and 
assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few close 
friends .I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have 
decided to give alms to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of 
the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have Distributed money to 
somecharity organizations in the U.A.E, Somalia and Malaysia. 

Now that my healthhas deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore. I once asked 
members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute the money 
which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they 
refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them 
anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left for them. 
The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of 
Twenty Eight Million dollars($28,000,000,00) that I have with a 
finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this 
deposit and despatch it to charity organizations. 

N/B:KINDLY NOTE THAT 60% of this funds must go to the tsunami victims,35% 
should go to the victims of huricane in the United Statea of America and 
another 5% for your effort and time. 
Please note that all correspondence as regards this project should be 
directed to my private mail box.

I await your prompt response. 

Thanks, 
Martin Mccourt.
