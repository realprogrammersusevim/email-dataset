of Iraq before the war=2EIt became the responsibility of the Allied soldiers to search for=2Crecover this money and plough it back 
into the governance of Iraq=2E In the proccess of securing the money running into hundreds of millions of US Dollars=2Cwe were

under the control of Allied Forces in Iraq=2E 
I initially thought that my stay in prison awaiting trial would be brief but I have spent some time here without any change in 
my hopeless situation! Now that I dont know how long I would stay here=2Cand faced with the possibility of dismissal from the 
Army if I am found guilty=2CI have come to accept that it is only proper to try and make some kind of reliable contact who could
