>From The Desk of:
MR.Sadik Adebayo (FINANCIAL DIRECTOR)
UNION BANK OF NIGERIA PLC.

Dear Sir, 
                        BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
Please permit me to introduce myself. 
I am the Financial Director of Union Bank of Nigeria
PLC. Union Bank is one of the biggest Commercial Banks
in Nigeria. The Board of Directors of the Bank met on
the 13th of November over a matter that requires your
co-operation and assistance.
In 1996, one of our esteemed customers, Mr. Adil
Bantam, an Indonesian citizen who died in a plane
crash along with members of his family. The 
ADC plane crashed into the Atlantic Ocean off the
coast of Lagos, killing all the passengers and crew.
Before the death of Mr. Adil Bantam, he 
was the Managing Director of Deep-blue Oil Servicing
Company. His company has both current and savings
accounts with our Bank. At the time of his death, he
had US$26.6Million in both accounts.When our Bank was 
notified of his death, we made efforts to contact his
immediate next of kin through his embassy in Victoria
Island, Lagos. The embassy later wrote to us informing
us that all attempt on their part to contact any of 
his relatives was not successful. It was at this point
we contacted the government of Nigeria through the
Ministry of Finance informing them about this problem.
The government wrote to us back directing our Bank to 
place Mr. Adil Bantam funds in a suspense account
pending when any of his relatives shows up to claim
the money. This was in 1996.
However, we received instructions from the Nigerian
Government giving us till the end of December  2002 to
disburse this fund to the next of kin of Mr. Adil
Bantam, or the money will be used to buy arms to
support the civil wars in Sierra Leone and Angola. It
was as a result of these directives from government
that made the Board of Directors of our Bank 
to meet. After careful considerations of the intention
of government to use the money to support war instead
of eradicating disease and poverty, the board then
mandated me to contact you for assistance to receive 
this money as the next of kin to Mr. Adil Bantam.
What we want to do is to present you or your company
as the next of kin to Mr. Adil Bantam which will
entitle you to receive this money on his 
behalf. It will not be difficult to establish the
relationship. You could be a relative to his later
wife or his uncle from his mothers side. 
As soon as you confirm your willingness to assist, you
shall be provided with all information relating to the
Late Mr.Adil Bantam, as contained in our file. You do
not have to worry about this proposal, as the 
Board of Union Bank is 100% behind this proposal. When
we have successfully remitted the fund in your
account, you shall assist us invest our 
shares into profitable business in your country for
2years. Your interest will be 30% of the total sum
after the successful completion of this 
transaction.Sir, should you be willing to assist in
this matter,kindly get back to me on my Telephone
number +234-803-3044193 stating your telephone and fax
numbers along with your bank detail were the money
will be transfer to and any question you may need  to
ask about this transaction. We want to assure you of a
hitch free transaction, as your involvement will not
expose you to any risks now or after the successful
completion of the transaction.
We thank you once more while we look forward to your
urgent response to this letter.

Best regards,
MR.Sadik Adebayo.
