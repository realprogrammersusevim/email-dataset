Dear Sir,

I got your contact on my private search for a reliable and trusted person=
 to handle a transaction of this nature. I know that
the contents of this mail might sound so strange, but I want to assure yo=
u that every word of it is true.I am Mr.Abgottspon Ewald, a credit office=
r with Banque Jacob Safra(Schweiz)AG.I have a concealed business suggesti=
on for you.Before the=20
plane crash of Mrs.Dimka Ilkova Boskovic on February 26, 2004 ,Dimka Ilko=
va Boskovic from the Ministry of Foreign=20
Affairs,macedonia and also a business woman made a fixed deposit for 12 c=
alendar months, with a value of Nine Million,eight Hundred Thousand Unite=
d State Dollars only in my branch.You can visit this website:

52108cb5.html


The board of directors of my bank adopted a resolution and as the account=
ing officer to Mrs.Dimka Ilkova Boskovic I was mandated to provide her ne=
xt of kin for the payment of this money within 14 working days or forfeit=
 the money to the bank as an abandoned property. Further investigations r=
evealed that Dimka Ilkova Boskovic did not declare any next of kin in her=
 official papers including the paper work of his bank deposit. And she al=
so confided in me the last time she was at my office that no one except m=
e knew of her deposit in my bank. So Nine Million,eight Hundred Thousand =
United State Dollars is still lying in my bank and no one will ever come =
forward to claim it. What bothers me most is that the directors of my ban=
k had planned to invoke the abandoned property decree of 1991 to confisca=
te the funds after the expiration of the period given to me, despairing a=
t the point of exhaustiveness but fortunately, I came across your name. M=
y suggestion=20
to you is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to Dimka Ilkov=
a Boskovic so that you will be able to receive this funds.

However, I seek your consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the dec=
eased. I have contacted an attorney that will prepare the necessary docum=
ent that will back you up as the next of kin to Dimka Ilkova Boskovic. Al=
l I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal through=
. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement t=
hat will protect you from any breach of law. Be Inform also that we shall=
 share the funds in the ratio 70% for me and 25% for you, while 5% should=
 be for Expenses or Tax as your Government may require. Please endeavor t=
o observe utmost discretion in all matters concerning this issue. I will =
bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction=20
when I hear from you. Your earliest response to this letter will be appre=
ciated via my private email address(aewald2000@msn.com).


Kind Regards,
Mr.Abgottspon Ewald.
