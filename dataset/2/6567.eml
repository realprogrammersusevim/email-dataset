Dear Sir,

I am Barrister Tunde Dosumu (SAN) solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney to Mr. Eton Simon, a national of your country, who used to work with Shell Petroleum Development Company (SPDC)here in Nigeria. Here in after shall be referred to  me as my client.  On the 21st of April 2000, my client, his wife And  their three children were involved in a car accident along Sagbama Express Road. All occupants of the  vehicle unfortunately lost there lives.  Since then I  have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate  any of my clients extended relatives this has also  proved unsuccessful. 

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided  to track his last name over the Internet, to locate  any member of his family hence I contacted you.  I  have contacted you to assist in repatrating the money  and property left behind by my client before they get confisicated or declared unserviceable by the bank  where this huge deposits were lodged, particularly, the CITI TRUST BANK where the deceased had an  account valued at about US$14.7million dollars . The bank has issued me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated within the next ten official
working days. 

Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the deceased since
you have the same last name  so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$14.7 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and me can share the money. I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we may make.

All I require is your honest co-operation  to enable us see this dealthrough. I  guarantee that this will be executed under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please get in touch with me via my private email address of barrister_tunde@lawyer.com to enable us discuss further. Or, call me on 234-80-33-432-485

Best regards,


Barrister Tunde Dosumu (SAN).
