FROM THE DESK OF
OLUFEMI WILLIAMS
HEAD FINANCE DEPARTMENT
NIGERIAN PORTS AUTHORITY
LAGOS.


Dear Sir,=20
RE: URGENT & CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS PROPOSAL.
Although this proposal might come to you as a
surprise, since it is from someone you do not know or have
seen before, but based on recommendations, I
gathered from a very reliable source here in Nigeria.
I am the Director, fund co-ordinator of the Finance
Contract Department of Nigerian Ports Authority.
The crux of this letter is that the finance/contract
department of the NPA deliberately over-inflated the
contact values of various contract awarded. In the
course of disbursement my office was able to track
down the sum of US$23.5M(Twenty Three Million, Five
Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) as the over invoiced
sum. This money is now floating in the NPA domiciliary
account with the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN). I and my
colleagues now want to quickly transfer this fund to a safe
nominated foreign account for possible investment abroad.
We are not allowed as a matter of government policy to
operate any foreign account because of our status as
civil/public servants. Hence the need to solicit for your
full banking details, to enable us transfer this money into
your account.
Upon your acceptance of this proposal, we have also
agreed on a sharing ratio:=20
1 25% for you as the account owner=20
2 65% for I and my colleagues
3 10% will be set aside to defray all incidental=20
expenses both locally and internationally during the
course of this transaction.
Furthermore, we shall be coming over to your country when
the money is finally in your account and we shall be relying
on your advise as regards to investment of our share. Be
informed that, this business is genuine and 100% safe
considering the high powered government officials involved.
Send by mail the following informations:-
1, YOUR COMPANY NAME AND ADDRESS, BANK NAME, ADDRESS
AND ACCOUNT NUMBER.
2, YOUR TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBER FOR EFFECTIVE
COMMUNICATION.=20
This is to effect the swift Transfer of this fund into your
account in less than Seven (7) working days.
Expecting your immediate response while
looking forward to a healthy business relationship
with you.
Yours faithfully,
OLUFEMI WILLIAMS
