Dear Receiver ,

As the Deputy General Manager Financial Management Division, it is my duty to send in a financial report to my head office in the capital at the end of each business year, in the course of last years business report, I discovered that my branch in which I am the D.G.M. Financial Management 
Div. made Three Million United States Dollars ($3,000,000USD) which my head office are not aware of and will never be aware of.  I have placed this fund on Escrow Account with no beneficiary.

There are practically no risks involved, it will be a bank to bank transfer.
