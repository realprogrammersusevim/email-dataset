Dear Receiver ,

Greetings to you and your family, I got your contact from the Hong Kong-American  Chamber of Commerce as a reliable and trust worthy person.I need a reputable and reliable person to assist me in an urgent need which requiring utmost trust. I know this letter might come as a surprise
to you, but I want to assure you that I humbly seek your assistance with the best of intentions. I solicit for your understanding and co-operation in this transaction as it will be beneficial to both of us.

As the Deputy General Manager Financial Management Division, it is my duty to send in a financial report to my head office in the capital at the end of each business year, in the course of last years business report, I discovered that my branch in which I am the D.G.M. Financial Management 
Div. made Three Million United States Dollars ($3,000,000USD) which my head office are not aware of and will never be aware of.  I have placed this fund on Escrow Account with no beneficiary. As an officer of this bank I cannot be directly connected to this money, hence the reason for my contacting you is to assist me in standing as the original depositor who made the deposit in the Bank so that the bank can after verification make direct transfer to your designated bank account and get Nine Hundred Thousand United States Dollars from the total sum as commission. 


There are practically no risks involved, it will be a bank to bank transfer.
