inaugurated the New Patnership for African Development =28NEPAD=29=2E NEPAD 
is to streamline Africa towards achieving a common market=2C defence

various African countries have made whosoever contributions in 
hundreds of million dollars=2E We have equally received grants=2Faids 
from the EU=2C USA and other international governments and agencies=2E

all the money expected=2E I have also prepared my account which I have 
submitted to the AU High Command=2C and it has been approved by the AU 
Secratary-General=2C Dr=2E Amara Essy=2E However=2C in some of the money

monies from them=2E The money in excess and which I have kept out with

cannot openly put this money into any bank here in Addis Ababa=2C 
Ethiopia=2C the AU headquarters where I am now=2C or in any other part of

Spain which has an affliate offices in Ghana=2C Cot d'Ivoire and South Africa=2E These cities are safe havens for this kind of transaction=2E
