Hello,

I am writing you this mail today on personal grounds
and l implore you to get back to me in earnest. I am
interested in doing business with your humble self,
but before I proceed further, I want you to please
note that this is not a sort of joke, I mean business.

I want to invest heavily in your country and other
countries within your geographical zone as you may
indicate as ideal. Once you are interested in this
proposed joint venture transaction, I will be giving
you a breakdown; we will start relating with each.

As you may wish to know, I am the director of P.P.M.C
(Petroleum Products Marketing Company); a subsidiary
of Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation,CC N.N.P.C.
My office is in charge of selling crude oil to foreign
companies/countries that come to lift or buy oil as
well as registering and certifying each and every one
of them before a single barrel is lifted.=20

As a result of the recent upsurge in the price of
crude oil, I and some of my colleague make 30 cent on
a barrel and for over the period of 2 months, we had
realized US$50 M (FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS). As civil
servants getting this money out of my country
(Nigeria) for investment poses a problem, following
the fact that Government officials are prohibited from
running a foreign account, and as such, I crave your
indulgence to assist in this regard, if you wish to
assist, kindly mail me back. So we could go in to
business. Please Email me your response to my personal box:

(drgodianokocha@myway.com)=20

As the transaction progress, you stand the chance to
negotiate what your cut will be from the US$50 M
(FIFTY MILLION US DOLLARS).

I further assure you that this is a risk-free
business, Thank you for anticipated cooperation.=20

I shall be expecting your response.

I remain
Yours truly
Dr Godian Okocha
