 Dear Friend,
I am contacting you in regards to a business transfer of a hugh sum of 
money from a deceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this 
magnitude will make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring 
you that all will be well at the end of the day. We decided to contact 
you due to the urgency of this transaction.
PROPOSITION;
We discovered an abandoned sum of $14,300,000.00 (Fourteen Million 
Three Hundred Thousand Dollars) in an account that belongs to one of 
our foreign customers who died along with his entire family. Since his 
death, none of his next-of-kin or relations has come forward to lay 
claims to this money as the heir.
We cannot release the fund from his account unless someone applies  for 
claim as the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking 
guidelines. Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to have 
you stand as a next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will 
be carefully worked out by us for the funds ($14,300,000.00) to be 
released in your favour as the beneficiary's next of kin.
It may interest you to note that we have secured from the probate an 
order of madamus to locate any of deceased beneficiaries.Please 
acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance of our mutual 
business endeavour by furnishing me with the following;
1. Beneficiary name and address.
2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers.
These requirements will enable us file a letter of claim to the 
appropriate departments for necessary approvals in your favour before 
the transfer can be made. We shall be compensating you with 25% on 
final conclusion of this 
project, while the rest shall be for us. Your share stays with you 
while the rest shall be for us for investment purposes.
If this proposal is acceptable by you, do not take undue advantage of 
the trust we have bestowed in you.
I await your urgent mail.
Regards,
Mr.Frank Jim.
