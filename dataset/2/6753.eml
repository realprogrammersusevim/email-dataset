Dear Prospective Partner,
 
Accept my compliments. However strange or surprising this contact might seem =
to you, I ask that you give due consideration to its importance, as we both =
stand to benefit immensely. Though we have not met or know each other, this =
is a criterion I have used to select you, as I wish to cut off all ties with =
my people for security and safety reasons.
 
I am a stepson and personal aide to the Late General Robert Guei of blessed =
memory, former President of Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast).
 
You may not be conversant with the present situation in my country, which has =
gradually degenerated into a civil war. On September 19, 2002, My Dad led a =
failed coup d'etat against President Laurent Gbagbo, in a bid to restore =
political stability in my country. Unfortunately, he was killed. After my =
Dad's death, there was confusion and power struggle in our camp; this led to =
an insurgence of several factions and has left no hope for peace anytime =
nearby.  To understand more on the situation click on this link =
http://www.state.gov/p/af/rls/rm/17657.htm 
 
 I decided to flee my country, as I desired a peaceful life, and I no more =
had interest in conflicts and wars. 
 
To the point, the essence of my contact with you is to seek your most needed =
assistance to siphon US$18,500,000 left in the bunker of my Dad=92s Private =
Palace. Only my Dad and me knew about this fund. Now that my Dad is dead, I =
intend to use this money for my personal benefit (as well as yours if you =
accept to be my partner). I see justification in diverting the money, rather =
using it to support the purchase of weapons for destruction of innocent lives =
and properties.
This money has been moved in cash in a trunk to my present location in Europe =
through diplomatic means. I plan to invest this money in diversified =
projects, and relocate to a private location. As you can understand, the kind =
of trust and confidence I want to place in you is extraordinary, and an act =
of desperation on my part, in order have my plans achieved in the shortest =
possible time. When the trunk is claimed, we shall firstly have the money =
deposited into an Offshore account in your name, as I am being discrete of =
using my name for now. Then you shall have your own share withdrawn to an =
account of your choice, and leave the rest as fixed deposit, for release to =
me at the appropriate time for the investments and my relocation. 
Also, ensure that this contact with you should be treated with utmost =
secrecy. Be informed that I am confiding in you by disclosing all this =
information to you, hence it is only me (apparently you now) that have =
knowledge of this. The importance of prosecuting this within the next few =
days cannot be overlooked; hence your immediate response will be highly =
appreciated.
If you accept to assist me, for your reliable assistance, I will reward you =
with 15%($2,775,000) of the money. 
On hearing from you, I shall disclose my location to you, and explain details =
of your role in this. Furthermore, everything regarding this process will be =
legally processed for transfer of ownership to you, and this transaction =
should be completed in a very short while, depending on your prompt response.=

I thank you in advance as I anticipate your assistance in enabling me achieve =
this goal. 
Please contact me whether or not you are interested in assisting me. This =
will enable me scout for another partner in the event of non-interest on your =
part.
Sincerely,
J.C.G.
