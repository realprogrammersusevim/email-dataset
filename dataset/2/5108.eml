Dear Friend,

I write to seek your cooperation as my foreign partner and your 
assistance to enable us to own properties and invest in the stable economy of 
your country. I apologize if this mail does not suit your personal or 
business ethics.

My names are Dr.shele kamasutu. We are making this venture 
proposal to you in strict confidence. As senior civil servants in the South 
Africa Government, the South African civil service laws (Code of Conduct 
bureau) forbid us to own a foreign account. The money we have in our 
possession is an overdue payment bill totaling Twenty Six Million, Four 
Hundred and Twenty Six Thousand US Dollars (US$26,426,000.00) which we 
want to transfer abroad with the assistance and co-operation of a 
company/or an individual to receive the said funds, via a reliable Bank 
Account.

If you will like to assist us as a partner, then indicate your interest 
after which we shall both discuss on the modalities. All other 
information to facilitate the remittance of the funds will be revealed to you 
in due course. For your assistance, you shall receive 30% amounting to 
US$7,927,800.00 of the US$26.426Million, 60% amounting to US$15,855,600 
for us and 10% amounting to US$2,642,600 will be used to settle 
taxation and other miscellaneous expenses in the course of transferring the 
funds to your account. 

Please indicate your direct telephone and direct fax number when 
replying this business proposal preferably through my alternative address: 
drshelekamasutu@indiatimes.com. I will call you when necessary. If you are not 
interested, please also indicate so that it will enable me to contact other 
foreign partner with recommendations to carry out this deal. 

A swift acknowledgment on the receipt of this mail will be appreciated.

Thank you and God bless you.

Best regards,

dr shele kamasutu
