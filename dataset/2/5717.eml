Hello,

I am Mr. Huston J. Shoetan, an Account officer to Late Engr. Noah Neiman =
who used to work with Aramaz Oil Servicing and Construction Company Ltd. =
Before his death on the 20th of October 2003 (Engr. Noah Neiman with his =
Wife and three children were involved in a car accident along Gilam expre=
ss road in which all occupants of the car died) Late Engr. Noah Neiman de=
posited the sum of US$7.2Million (Seven Million, Two Hundred Thousand US =
Dollars Only) with my bank with the hope of transferring the Fund to his =
country, during his annual leave, when it would be most convenient for hi=
m. Unfortunately, this fatal accident occurred and he could no longer rec=
eive his money. After several unsuccessful attempts and enquiries made to=
 locate his relatives through your embassy and other means proved negativ=
e, I decided to trace his last name through the Internet by all means to =
locate any member of his family hence I contacted you. I contacted you ev=
en as you don&#8217;t bear the same last name with my late client, it is =
because of the time frame I have been given as his personal account offic=
er to come up with his next of kin or have the funds confiscated. I will =
not want my government to confiscate this fund; hence I contacted you. I =
have the authority as his personal account officer to present any one to =
stand as his next of kin. I have employed the services of a reputable law=
yer who is ready to work with us and there are also going to be legal doc=
uments that will be secured in your favor to back up this claim from the =
federal high court of law here by the lawyer.


I want you to assist in repatriating the fund left behind by Late Engr. N=
oah Neiman before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by my ba=
nk where these huge deposits were lodged and my bank had issued me (being=
 his account officer) a notice to provide his next of kin or have the fun=
d confiscated. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives f=
or over some years now, I seek your consent to present you as the next of=
 kin of the deceased so that the proceeds of this fund valued at US$7.2Mi=
llion dollars can be released to you as the beneficiary. Then you and I c=
an share the money - 70% to me, then 40% to you. I have arranged with a L=
awyer to provide all necessary legal documents that will be used to back =
up this claim. There is no risk of any type in this business; I assure yo=
u in confidence.


All I require is your honest co-operation/trust to enable us seeing this =
deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate a=
rrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please I wil=
l require you send to me immediately your full names, your private phone =
and fax numbers and your address for immediate approval at the Court by B=
arrister Samuel Isetun in your name as the next of kin and beneficiary=20
of the money.


Please I will like you to send the required information so that Barrister=
 Samuel Isetun can start up the process. I will also ask that you call me=
 on telephone number: 234-8077088667 to confirm this so as to enable me c=
ontact Barrister Samuel Isetun whom will be fronting on your behalf in th=
is regards so that he can proceed to the federal high court to start the =
process of securing all the legal documents that shall be used to back up=
 this claims.=20
Please I will like to inform you that I will take full responsibility of =
any fee in this transaction so you do not have to spend anything. All I n=
eed is your
 assistance to stand as the next of kin to my late client so that the mon=
ey can be transferred into your account as the beneficiary.

Yours Sincerely,

Mr. Huston J. Shoetan.
