 My name is Mr=2E Fredrick Andrew=2E I trained and work as an external auditor for the Development Bank of Singapore =28DBS=29 of Singapore=2E I have taken pains to find your contact through personal endeavours because a late investor =2C who bears the same last name with you has left monies totaling a little over $10 million United States Dollars with Our Bank for the past twelve years and no next of kin has come forward all these years=2E

I have seized all relevant information =28legal and Banking=29 that will facilitate our putting you forward as the claimant=2Fbeneficiary of the funds and ultimately transfer the money to any account nominated by you=2E Be assured that I and my colleagues are on top of the situation all the time and there will be no risk =2E
 

Needless to say=2C Uttermost CONFIDENTIALITY is of vital importance if we are to successfully reap the immense benefits of this transaction=2E I have intentionally left out the finer details for now until I hear from you=2E To affirm your willingness and cooperation to my proposal please do so by email=2C stating your full names=2C date of birth=2C telephone number and fax number=2E I do expect your prompt response=2E
