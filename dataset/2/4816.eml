My Dear ,

I'm glad to inform you about my success in getting those funds transferred under
the cooperation of a new partner from bangkok.
 Presently i'm in bangkok for investment projects with my own share of the total
sum. mean while,i never forget your past efforts and attempts to assist me in
transferring those funds despite that it failed us some how.

Now contact my secretary , his name is mr issiac ahokou through his e-mail ( 
issiac_ahokou@yahoo.fr) ask him to send you the total of $800.000.00 which i
kept for your compensation for all the past efforts and attempts to assist me
in this matter. I appreciated your efforts at that time very much. So feel free
and get intouched with my secretary  issiac and instruct him where to send the
amount to you.

Please do let me know immediately you receive it ,so that we can share the joy
after all the sufferness at that time. At the moment, I am very busy here
because of the investment projects which I and my partner are having at hand,
finally, remember that I had forwarded instruction to the secretary on your
behalf to receive that money, so feel free to get in touch with  issiac, he
will send the amount to you without delay,ok!
good bye .

 best regards,
Dr. zanou
