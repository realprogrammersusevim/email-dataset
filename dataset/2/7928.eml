 Sir,
 
 Compliment of the day and how is life general with
 you? Of course it is my humble wish to solicit and
 crave your indulgence to make this project request
 for
 a joint business transaction which I hope will not
 come to you as a surprise, hence I plead for your
 pardon.  
 I am Mike Igbo, the manager of headquarter first
 bank
 of Nig. Plc. Lagos. I have an urgent and
 confidential
 business proposal for you. 
 
 On June 6, 1997, an Australian oil
 consultant/contractor with via National Petroleum
 cooperation (NNPC) Mr. Peter Bush made a numbered
 time
 (fixed) deposit for twelve calenderer month valued
 at
 US$25,000, 000. 00(Twenty-Five Million US Dollars)
 in
 my branch.
 
 On maturity, I sent a routine notification to his
 forwarded address but got no reply after months we
 send a reminder and finally we discovered from his
 contract employee (Nigeria national petroleum
 Corporation) that Mr. Peter Bush died from an
 automobile accident. On further investigation, it
 was
 clear that he died without making a will. All
 attempts by the Australian to trace his next of kin
 were fruitless.
 
 I therefore made further investigation and
 discovered
 that Mr. Peter Bush did not declare any next of kin
 or
 relations in all his official documents including
 his
 deposit document in my bank. The total sum
 US$25,000,000.00 is still in my bank as dormant
 acct.
 No one will ever come forward to claim it. According
 to Nigerian banking law, after five years, the money
 will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
 Government. If the account owner is certified death
 and nobody comes forward to claim it.
 
 This is the situation, and my proposal is that I am
 looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the
 beneficiary/next of kin. This is simple. All you
 have
 to do is to immediately send me the details of a
 bank
 account anywhere in the world for me to arrange the
 proper money transfer document. The money will then
 be
 transferred into the account for us to share in the
 ration of 60% for me 30% for you while the remaining
 10% will be set aside for expenses incurred with
 here
 and there.
 
 There is no risk involved. I am using my position
 and
 connection in the bank here to do all the document
 work for the transaction. We shall employ the
 services
 of an attorney to draft the will and obtain all
 necessary documents and letter of administration in
 your favor for the transfer. This transaction is
 risk
 free guaranteed. If you are interested, please reply
 immediately confidentiality and be rest assured that
 this transaction could be most profitable for both
 of
 us. Please do not expose this deal if you are not
 interested because if you do, it will take me out of
 seat.
 
 I am awaiting your urgent reply.
 
 Best regards,
 
  Mike Igbo.
