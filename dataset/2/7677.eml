Dear Sir=2FMadam=2C

This mail will definitely be coming to you as a surprise=2C but I must 
crave your indulgence to introduce myself to you=2E

I am Mr=2E John mensah Sulikuh=2C a supervisory manager at the United Trust Bank 
Ltd=2CLondon=2E However I got your contact through the International web 
directory=2ERecently we discovered a Dormant Account with a huge Amount of
Money 
ValuedUSD17=2C 600=2C000=2E00 =28Seventeen Million=2C six hundred Dollars Only=29 that 
belongs to One of our late Customer MR=2E KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS=2E who died In a 
plane crash=2E During our investigation and auditing in this bank=2C my
Department came Across a very huge sum of money belonging to MR=2E
KRAANVOGEL DIONIJS from Beverwijk=2C Netherlands=2C who died along with his
wife=2C MRS=2E KATRIEN DIONIJS and Daughter=2C MS=2E SOFIE DIONIJS so the fund has
Been dormant in his account with this Bank without Any claim of the fund in
our custody either from his Family or relation before Our discovery to this
development=2E

The Banking law here stipulates that if such money remains unclaimed for 15
years=2C it will be forfeited to the Bank Treasury as an unclaimed bill=2E It is
only a foreigner that can stand as a next of kin and it is upon this
discovery that I decided to contact you to collaborate with you to pull out
this dormant fund=2EIn order to avert this negative development=2E On behalf of
my trusted colleagues we now seek your permission to have you stand in as
next of kin to Our late Customer so that the fund will be released and 
paid into your account as the beneficiary=92s next of kin now that the bank is
still expecting a next of kin or relative of the deceased=2C MR=2E KRAANVOGEL
DIONIJS=2E 

We could have done this deal alone but because of our position in this
country as civil servants=2C we are not allowed to operate a foreign account
and that would eventually raise an eye brow on our side during the time of
transfer since we still work in this bank=2C this is the actual reason why
we required a second party or fellow who will assist us forward claims as
the next of kin and also provide either an existing bank account or to set
up a new Bank a=2Fc immediately to receive this fund=2C even an empty a=2Fc can
also serve for this purpose=2E

However=2C on smooth conclusion of this transaction=2C you will be entitled to
25% as gratification for your assistance to us=2C while 5% will be set aside
to take care of expenses on both sides that may arise during the time of
transfer and also for telephone bills=2C and the remaining 70% will be for me
and my colleague=2E

What I want from you is for you to act as the deceased next of kin=2E I have
in my possession=2C all the necessary Documents to successfully accomplish
the operation=2E Bear in mind that this proposal is 100% risk free=2E Further
Information will be given to you as soon as I receive your positive
response=2E I suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your
wish=2E For confidentiality please contact me on my personal email
