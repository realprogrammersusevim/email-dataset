Bismillahir Rahmaanir Raheem,
Assalamo Alaikum,

Wasalaam to you,and how are you doing?. My intention of contacting you is to =
solicit your assistance for a project,  which will be mutually beneficial. =
Though I know my decision to contact you is to a large extent unconventional, =
the  prevailing circumstances necessitated my action. I am Haleema  Hamza =
from Libya. I am married to Late Mallam Mustafa Hamza of blessed memory was =
an oil explorer in Libya and Kuwait for twelve years before he died in the =
year 2000. We were married  for twelve years without a child. He died after a =
brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both =
devoted Muslims. Since his death I too have been battling with both Cancer =
and fibroid problems.When my late Husband was alive he made a huge deposit in =
millions of US dollars with a Deposit Company in oversea. (I will tell you =
the amount as we proceed).

Recently, my doctor told me that I have only few months to live due to cancer =
problem. Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness. Having known my =
condition I decided to donate this fund to either a Muslim organization or =
devoted Muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to =
instruct herein. My parents died at a tender age and i was brought up in the =
orphanage through the help of a devouted muslim.I want this Muslim =
organization or individual to use this money in all sincerity to fund =
mosques,  orphanages, widows, and also propagating the word of ALLAH and to =
ensure that the society upholds the views and belief of the Holy Quran.

The Holy Quran emphasizes so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has =
encouraged me to take the bold step. I took this decision because I don't =
have any child that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are into =
some radical Organizations and I don't want a situation where this money will =
be used in an Unholy manner. Hence the reasons for this 
bold decision, I know that after death I will be with ALLAH the most =
beneficent and the most merciful. I don't need any telephone communication in =
this regard because of my health, because of the presence of my husband's =
relatives around me always. I don't want them to know about this development. =
With ALLAH all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply on =
Email:hhamza@cooltoad.com, I shall give you the contact information of the =
Deposit Company in oversea where the money was deposited. I will also issue a =
letter of authority to the Deposit Company authorizing them that the said =
fund have being willed to you and a copy of such authorization will be =
forwarded to you. I want you and the Muslim community where you reside to =
always pray for me. My happiness is that I lived a true devoted Muslims =
worthy of emulation, Whoever that wants to serve ALLAH must serve him in =
truth and in fairness. I will not stipulate any precise amount to reward you, =
as it will have to be on pre-negotiated terms, based on your level of =
involvement. 
Please always be prayerful all through your life. Any delay in your reply =
will give room in sourcing for a Muslim organization or a devoted Muslim for =
this same purpose. Until I hear from you by email, my dreams will rest =
squarely on your Shoulders. May the Almighty ALLAH continue to guide and  =
protect you.
     Allah Hafiz.
    Haleema Hamza.
