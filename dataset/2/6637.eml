<DIV class=RTE><BR>Dear Friend,</DIV>
<DIV class=RTE>&nbsp;I am Mrs Catherine Schole, Auditing Assistant in a Bank here in london<BR>with branches all over europe. I have urgent and very confidential<BR>business proposition for you.</DIV>
<DIV class=RTE>&nbsp;In my department, I discovered an abandoned sum of $6.2 million us<BR>dollars (six million two hundred thousand united state dollars) in an<BR>account that belongs to one of our foreign customers&nbsp; an American<BR>who unfortunately lost his life in the plane crash of Alaska Airlines<BR>Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, including his wife and<BR>only daughter.Visiting site at:</DIV>
<DIV class=RTE>&nbsp;<A href="http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/">http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/</A> </DIV>
<DIV class=RTE><BR>&nbsp;Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his only <BR>Daughter died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with <BR>the Knowledge of this fund behind for the claim.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>&nbsp;This sum of US$6,200,000.00 is still sitting in our branch bank<BR>and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end <BR>of each year. According to Laws of the&nbsp; bank, at the expiration of 5 (five)<BR>years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Government<BR>if nobody applies to claim the fund.</DIV>
<DIV class=RTE>&nbsp;Consequently, i will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the <BR>next of kin . I need your full name and address <BR>for&nbsp; the attorney to prepare the necessary documents and affidavits <BR>that will put you in place as the next of kin. The money will be paid <BR>into your account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and 30% <BR>for you.<BR>&nbsp;<BR>Awaiting your urgent reply via my personal email: <BR>&nbsp;<BR><A href="mailto:mrsscholess@yahoo.co.uk">mrsscholess@yahoo.co.uk</A><BR>&nbsp;<BR>Phone number +44-703-194-2033</DIV>
<DIV class=RTE>Thanks and regards,</DIV>
<DIV class=RTE>Mrs Catherine Schole. </DIV>
