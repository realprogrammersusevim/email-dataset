FROM THE DESK OF: Dr.Ouadrago Yamkine Issak,
IBA INTERNATIONAL  BANK OF BURKINA FASO.
AFRICA.WEST COAST.BRANCH.
{USD10,MILLION TO TRANSFER}


Dear Sir/Madam,

I am Dr.OuadragoYamkine Issak, director INTERNATIONAL BANK OF incharge   
Africa bank {IBA}. I have urgent and very confidential  business proposal 
for you.An American Gold consultant/contractor with the burkina  faso west  
African Solid Gold Corporation,mr  Morris Thompson made a numbered time 
(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months,valued at US$10,000,000.00 (TEN 
Million Dollars) in my branch.

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but 
got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered 
from his contract employers, the west African Solid Gold Corporation that 
Morris Thompson died in a plane crash in Alaska Airlines Flight 261(for more 
information about this crash and person you can contact this website:
http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list
since we got this information about his death. On further investigation, I 
found out that he died without making a WILL, and all attempts to trace his 
next of kin was fruitless.

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr  Morris 
Thompson did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents, 
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in the Bank. This sum of 
US$10,000,000.00 is still sitting in the Bank and the  interest is being 
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever 
come forward to claim it.
According to Laws of Republic OF BURKINA  FASO,  at the expiration of 4 
(four) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the burkina  faso 
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. Consequently, i am due to 
retire from office next year 2007,

My proposal is that I will like you tp come in as a next kin/ foreigner to 
stand in as the next of kin to Mr.Morris Thompson so that the fruits of this 
old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt government 
officials.
This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names and 
address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and 
affidavits that will put you in place as the next of kin.through the bank 
attorney as soon as you put application to the bank.We shall employ the 
services of an attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL as  the 
bank will approve you as  the next of kin and to obtain the necessary 
documents and letter of probate/administration in your favor for the 
transfer.

A bank account in any part of the world that you will provide will then 
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. 
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 75% 
for me and 20% for you.then 5%will be map out for any expenses that may 
occure during transactions.
There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be 
done by the attorney as will employ him on  the approval of the bank; i am 
notifying  you this as a secret of mine, as a senior bank officer.i knew all 
  what it takes  to get  this funds out of  the bank. and my position and 
that of YOU  qarantees the successful execution of this transaction. If you 
are interested, please reply immediately via the private email address 
above. Upon your response, I shall then provide you with more details and 
relevant application letter  that will help you understand the transaction. 
Please send me your confidential telephone and fax numbers for easy 
communication.

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this 
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require 
your assistance to invest my share in your country.


Awaiting your urgent reply
Best Regard.
Dr.Ouadrago Issak Yamkine,
