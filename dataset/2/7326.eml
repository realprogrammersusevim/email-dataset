Dear Sir,


I am Mr. JJ WALTER the Auditor General of United Bank Of
Africa(UBA). There Is an Account opened in this bank
in 1980 and since 1990 no body has Operated on this account again. After
going through some old files in the records I discovered that if I do not remit this money out urgently it would be fortified for nothing. The owner of this account is Dr.Phillip Morris , a Foreigner and a miner at delth Gold Co, a geologist by Profession. He died since 1990. And no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it. The account has no other beneficiary and my Investigation Proved to me as well that his company does not know anything about his Account and
the amount involved is USD 36m) Thirty Six Million United States Dollars.

I am only contacting you as a foreigner because the bank is going to welcome you as a foreigner and for the fact you have the correct information about the account, which I will give to you before we proceed. I strongly believe in God that you will never let me down in this business because you are the only person i have contacted in this business. I need youre full co-operation to make this work fine.If you are Capable to handle such amount in strict confidence and trust according to My instructions and advice we will achieve this money immediately, because this opportunity might not Come again in life. I will also use my Position in the bank to Influence and affect legal
approvals and immediate onward transfer of this Money into your account with appropriate clearance from the ministries and Foreign Exchange department. Once we conclude this transfer, you will get 25% of the total amount as your own share. As soon as I receive your response, we will proceed with the transfer. I look forward to your earliest reply through this email or jj_walter3@yahoo.com 

Yours sincerely,

Mr. JJ WALTER
