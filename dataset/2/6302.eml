 Dear Sir=2C

 by giving me the go ahead to have you presented to the
 Bank as the next of kin through a lawyer=2EI will tell
 you how to get a lawyer but it has to be confidential
 who will apply and present you as the next of KIN=2E

 AS soon as we make application=2C obtain the necessary
 approval=2C the money will be paid through here or any
 of the banks payment  centre Overseas=2EThis will take
 us about 10 working days to conclude  depending on how
 you respond to our correspondence=2E If you are  willing
 to stand in as the next of Kin =2Csend to me your full
 names =2Caddress=2Ctelephone and fax numbers=2E
 As soon as I get these information requested=2CI will then 
 brief you on the procedure that has to be taken to have this
 transaction concluded within a short period of time=2E
