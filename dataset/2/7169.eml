Good day,

Certainly yes, this proposal may come to you as a surprise. It is 
a privilege and it demands an utmost confidentiality and honesty. My 
name is Mrs. Mary Kabah wife of the former minister of mineral 
resources/economic planning in the presidency of tijan Kabah of Sierra Leone. My 
husband died recently as a result of an acute heart problem.

Right now, the funds are in a security company which has affiliate 
offices in Europe, Asia and West African. I am currently on transit 
awaiting an honest overseas partner for negotiations.

Though it is my desire to go into property investments or any other 
area of your choice you may advice. I will compensate for your assistance including any expenses you may incur before the 
successful completion of this transaction.
