Iraq.I am contacting you base on trust and humanitarian assistance which I=

you. The recent concluded US led war against my country has left my family=

totally devastated as I
lost my Husband to the cold hands of death and the children lost thei=20
father.Long before this war
started, my late husband had in his custody $20.7 Million U.S Dollars, but =
due=20
to serious threat of war
from the United States and the collision forces (if our dictator president=
=20
does not amend his ways), my
husband had to act fast and at such deposited these funds in a Diplomatic=
=20
Condominium in a neighboring
country for the purpose of our family survival after the war might have bee=
n=20
over.

I am writing you this letter because our dreams was not fulfilled as we cou=
ld=20

war but we did however succeeded in getting the children to a neighboring=
=20
country first before trying
to proceed with getting ourselves out. It was in the process of us (my Husb=
and=20
and I) escaping to a
neighboring country that we came under friendly fire. It was this mistake t=
hat=20
took my husband=E2=80=99s life and
critically injured me as the truck we were in went out of control into a br=
ick=20
wall. I was rushed to a
military hospital in a neighboring country where I am currently admitted an=
d=20
writing this
letter. I am recovering well and now that my health has improved dramatical=
ly,=20
I need to think of the
futureof my Children and who to trust in sending theentire amount kept by m=
y=20
late husband for investment
and acquiring immigration papers for my children.=20

If you believe you can assist me on this endeavor,kindly reply me at=20
