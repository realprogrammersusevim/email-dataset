Lagos-Nigeria
Dear Sir/Madam
I am Dr Martins Awele Chairman of the Tender Committee
of the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC). My Committee is
principally
concerned with payment of all contract awarded from 1999 to date, in 
order
of priority as regard capital projects of the NNPC.
The information we gathered from the Foreign Office
of the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industries is so positive as to
convince us that you would provide us with solution to a money transfer
deal valued at Thirty One Million United States Dollars and 
subsequently
a joint business venture.

In the course of our duties as values, and project
inspectors for the on-going liquefied Natural Gas
(LNG) project, we have over-invoiced the value of
somejobs done by foreign contractors for the NNPC to the tune of 
US$31M.
As follows: -
Computer optimization and Installation $16,000.000.00
Installation of 250,000.00 Monax
Turbine$10,000.000.00
Turn Around Maintenance $5,000,000.00
Our aim of over-invoicing this payment is to divert
the excess amount to a discrete account abroad. This fund is now 
floating
in suspense account at the Central Bank of
 Nigeria (CBN).
This is the fund my colleagues and I have decided to transfer into your
account since we, as civil servants are not allowed to operate or own
foreign
account.
The money will be shared as follows after
 transfer:30% for you (Account Owner)
 60% for me and my colleagues 10% to off-set both
local and international expenses thatWould be incurred in the course of
this transaction.
To be able to claim the funds, we will be purporting your company to be
the original contractor / beneficiary of the funds so all procedures 
for
international transfer shall be strictly followed,as we have worked out
all modalities for a swift and riskfree transfer.

If this proposal satisfies you, please contact me via E-mail OR fax 
number
234-1-7592412
with the following important information. Bank Name / Address Account 
Name
Account Number and your Personal Phone / Fax Numbers for easy 
communication.


This transaction will last for 14 working days from
 the time we submit the required information, as all
 modalities concerning this transaction have been
 worked out and it is completely risk free.
 Please be informed that this subject is classified
 sensitive. Therefore treat the transaction with
 utmost confidentiality and urgency.
 Yours Faithfully,
 Dr Martins Awele
