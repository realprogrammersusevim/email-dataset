to the Civillian. I am Mrs. Mary Kobe, widow of late General John Kobe. I 
procured your contact information from my search for a reliable person who 
is capable of handling such a proposal of such a magnitude, as my late 
husband has made it that this proposal herein will be at the betterment of 
his family, as the person to be the foreign partner will take good care of 
his investment and family as well. My late husband was one of the victims of 
the Civil war. I have been informed by one of our family's attorney who is a 
South African citizen with the name Barrister Barrister cliff Alexaandern that my late 
husband operated a secret account with a fictitious name in the FIRST 
NATIONAL BANK here in Johannesburg. In this account, he has (Thirty-nine 
Million Dollars) $39,000,000 only, which was credited in his favour.

In my husband's 'WILL' he stated that one of his partners overseas will take 
care of his family/properties. The attorney is waiting for my late husband's 
partner overseas who is to take care of his family/properties according to 
his WILL. Since no mention was made in the WILL as to who the said partner 
is, I want you to take advantage of this upon receipt of this email, you are
