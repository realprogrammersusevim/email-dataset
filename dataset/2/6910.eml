ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND

ATTN,

  I am Mr OLIVER DONALD I am 50 years Of Age, a native of London .I got y=
our information while browsing through internet in search of a reliable p=
erson who will assist me. On 31st of July 2000, an Oil  consultant/contra=
ctor, Mr. Kurt Kahle with ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM COMPANY, he made a number=
ed time (fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$20,700,0=
00.00(Twenty Million Seven Hundred Thousand Dollars) with ROYAL BANK OF S=
COTLAND branch upon maturity. I sent a routine notification to his forwar=
ding address but got no reply.


After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his cont=
ract employers, the ROYAL DUTCH PETROLEUM COMPANY that On the 31st of Jul=
y 2000, our client, his wife and their Children died in the Air France co=
ncord plane crash bound for New York in their plan for a world cruise, wi=
th other passengers abroad as you can confirm it yourself via the website

below: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

on further investigation, I found out that he died without making a will,=
 and attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made fu=
rther investigation and discovered that Mr. Kurt Kahle   did not declare =
any next of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his=
 bank deposit paperwork in ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND. This sum of US$20,700,=
000.00 is still in ROYAL BANK OF SCOTLAND and the interest is being rolle=
d over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will ever c=
ome forward to claim it.


According to the law of the country, at the expiration of (five) years, t=
he money will revert to the ownership of the Scotland Government if nobod=
y applies to claim the fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will lik=
e you as a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to Mr. Kurt Kahle so tha=
t the fruit of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some  =
corrupt Government officials. This is simple, I will like you to provide =
immediately your full name and  address so that the Attorney will prepare=
 the necessary documents and affidavits, which will put you  in place as =
the next of kin to Mr. Kurt Kahle.


We shall employ the service of attorney for the drafting and notarization=
 of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of  probate/ad=
ministration in your favour for the transfer. Any bank account in any par=
t of the world that you will provide will then facilitate the transfer of=
 this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid=
 into your account for us to share in ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you=
. There is no risk at all; he attorney and my position will do the paperw=
ork for this transaction as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful =
execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please reply immedi=
ately via the private email address below, upon your response shall provi=
de you with more details and relevant documents that will help you unders=
tand the transaction.


Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this trans=
action  would be most profitable for both of us because i shall require y=
our assistance to invest my share in your country.Please upon the receipt=
 of this mail message, send to me the following, to enable start the proc=
ess of the fund into your bank account:

you are require to send the following document information through the ab=
ove e-mail(mr22oliver@yahoo.it  )

(1).Your full Name (2).Your private Telephone and fax numbers.
