Dear Sir=2C

trustworthy and capable of handling a business of this dimension=2E 

My name is Mr=2E Jonathan Mokoena=2C the Under-Secretary in charge of

Union =28AU=29=2C formerly Organization of Afriacn Unity =28OAU=29=2E You may be 
aware of the transformation of the OAU to AU=2C and the mandate to 
build a new united Africa modelled on the pattern of European Union 
=28EU=29=2E For this therefore=2C the various African leaders recently 
inaugurated the New Patnership for African Development =28NEPAD=29=2E NEPAD 
is to streamline Africa towards achieving a common market=2C defence 
force=2C currency=2C foreign policy=2C judiciary etc=2E For the above=2C the 
various African countries have made whosoever contributions in 
hundreds of million dollars=2E We have equally received grants=2Faids 
from the EU=2C USA and other international governments and agencies=2E 
These moneies in all have ran into millions of dollars=2E 


As the officer in charge of receiving and managing these funds and 
executing the projects for which they are ment for=2C I have received 
all the money expected=2E I have also prepared my account which I have 
submitted to the AU High Command=2C and it has been approved by the AU 
Secratary-General=2C Dr=2E Amara Essy=2E However=2C in some of the money 
received=2C some of the donor countries and international bodies 
remitted to us amounts in excess of what they pledged=2E The AU before 
now=2C has written to all of them to acknowledge the receipt of the 
monies from them=2E The money in excess and which I have kept out with 
only me having knowledge of it=2C is in the tune of Thirty-Five Million United States Dollars =28US$35=2C000=2C000=2E00=29=2E As it is now=2C this money belongs to me=2C as neither the AU nor any of the donor countries=2Finternational agencies has declared their money missing=2E

safe-keeping of this fund=2E As a public officer in my category=2C I 
cannot openly put this money into any bank here in Addis Ababa=2C 
Ethiopia=2C the AU headquarters where I am now=2C or in any other part of 
Africa=2C as an account holder=2E This will surely raise eyebrows and 
expose me=2E I have therefore concealed this amount of US$35M in four 
metal trunk boxes=2C and declared them as artefacts belonging to a 
foreigner=2E I deposited the boxes with a Security Company based in 
Spain which has an affliate offices in Ghana=2C Cot d'Ivoire and South Africa=2E These cities are safe havens for this kind of transaction=2E

this fund=2E I will furnish you with information=2Fdocuments on how 

you will stand as the beneficiary of the boxes=2E I have decided to 
give to you 40% of the total amount involved=2E

this transaction=2E
