DEAR SIR,<BR>
I AM AN OFFICER CORPORATE BANKING DEPARTMENT OF RENNIES BANK<BR>
S.A.[SOUTH AFRICA] MY DEPARTMENT RELATES MORE WITH THE AFFAIRS<BR>
OF THE STATE. VERY LATELY AN AMOUNT OF MONEY WAS DISCOVERED BY<BR>
US IN A SUSPENSE / AN ABANDONED ACCOUNT TO THE SUM OF FIFTEEN<BR>
POINT THREE MILLION US DOLLARS ONLY. AN ACCOUNT THAT BELONGED TO<BR>
ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY<BR>
ON NOVEMBER 1994 IN A GHASTLY PLANE CRASH. SINCE WE GOT<BR>
INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN EXPECTING HIS<BR>
NEXT-OF-KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY BECAUSE WE CANNOT<BR>
RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIED FOR IT AS NEXT- OF-KIN, OR<BR>
RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS INDI! C ATED IN OUR BANKING<BR>
GUIDELINES. UNFORTUNATELY, NOBODY HAS COME FOWARD TO CLAIM THIS<BR>

OR IS DORMANT FOR A PERIOD OF YEARS IS DEEMED CLOSED AND ALL MONEY CONTAINED<BR>
THEREIN FORFEITED TO THE GOVERNMENT TREASURY ACCOUNT.<BR>
NOW IT IS BEING SPECULATED THAT THE ABOVE SUM WILL BE TRANSFERED<BR>
INTO THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS AN UNCLAIMED FUND ON OR BEFORE<BR>
DECEMBER 2003. THE REASON FOR REQUESTING YOU TO PRESENT<BR>
YOURSELF AS NEXT-OF- KIN IS OCCA! SIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE<BR>
DECEASED (CUSTOMER) WAS A FOREIGNER.<BR>
THE MODE OF SHARING AFTER A SUCCESSFUL TRANSFER OF THE MONEY<BR>
INTO YOUR ACCOUNT: 70% TO MY COLLEAGUES AND I; FOR THE ROLE YOU<BR>
