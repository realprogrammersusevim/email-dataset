My Dear Friend,

Greetings:

I am sorry for sending you this message for the second time, please bear 
with me and respond.
My name is Mr. Melvin Samson I work as an accountant in a bank; I contacted 
you to work together with me in claiming my late client's estate. 
Unfortunately he died without a registered next of kin and as such the funds 
now have an open beneficiary status. You could be made the beneficiary since 
you share the same last name with him.

This has officially transferred the right to you, as no other person from 
his family knows anything about this fund with our bank.If you are 
interested in working with me,

please get back to me as quickly as possible so that I give you the details 
of what we are to  do. I wait for your prompt response so that I can give 
you more briefing of what you need to and how to do it.

Thanks for your co-operation.

Best regards,

Melvin.
