DEAR BELOVED,=20

I am Sussan Adams=20

PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above=20
named person. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I=E2=80=99m n=
ow=20
in Nigerian General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who=20
worked with U.S embassy in LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in=20
the year 2000. We were married for eleven years without a child. He=20
died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his=20
death we were both born again Christians. Since his death I decided not=20
to re-marry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible=20
is against.=20

When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million=20
(Ten Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently,=20
this money is still under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE=20
COMPANY Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next=20
SEVEN months due to my cancer=20
problems.=20

Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I=20
decided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or=20
muslim individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to=20
instruct here in. I want a church that will use this fund on,=20
orphanages, deaf and domb and poor widows propagating the word of God=20
and to ensure that the house of God is maintained. The Bible made us to=20
understand that blessed is the hand that giveth. I took this decision=20
because I don't have any child that will inherit this money and my=20
husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's hard=20
earned money to be misused by unbelievers. I don't want a situation=20
where this money will be used in an ungodly manner. Hence the reason=20
for taking this bold decision.=20

I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I=20
am going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the=20
lord will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any=20
telephone communication in this regard because of my health because of=20
the presence of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want=20
them to know about this development. With God all things are possible.=20
As soon as I receive your reply I forward your personal information,=20
such as Your full name, Your full address, with Your telephone and fax=20
number to my lawyer so that he will contact you as the legal owner of=20
my fund before the bank will be transferring the fund into your=20
nominated Bank Account in your country.=20

I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as=20
the real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want=20
you and the church to always pray for me because the lord is my=20
shepherd,you will also promise me that you will not seat on the fund=20
when it gets into your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a=20
life of a worthy Christian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must=20
serve him in spirit and truth. Please always be prayerful all through=20
your life, any delay in your reply will give me room in serching for a=20
church or Christian individual for this same purpose. Please assure me=20
that you will act accordingly as I stated herein. Hoping to hear from=20
you as soon as possible.=20

Remain blessed in the name of the Lord.=20

Yours in Christ,=20

Mrs. Sussan Adams
