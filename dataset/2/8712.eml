FROM THE DESK OF DR ALI IBRAHIM.
BILL AND EXCHANGE MANAGER,
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK -ADB ANNEX.
OUAGADOUGOU, BURKINA FASO.
IN WEST AFRICA.




PRIVATE CONFIDENTIAL NUMBER E-MAIL:dr_ ali_i1@hotmail.com

Dear Sir,



I am The Manager of Bill and Exchange at the Foreign Remittance Department 
of African Development bank(ADB).  I am writing following the impressive 
information about you through one of my friends who runs a consultancy firm 
in my country. He assured me of your capability and reliability to champion 
this businees opportunity.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 30m US dollars ( Thirty 
million US dollars) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign 
customer who died along with his entire family in november 2001 in a plane 
crash.

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt that all his 
supposed next of kin   or relation died alongside with him at the plane 
crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this 
discovery that I and other officials in my department now decided to make 
this businness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of 
kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since 
nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to go into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after six years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of  foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by 
the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot stand as 
next of kin to a foreigner.

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in
respect to the provision of a foreign account,  10 % will be set aside for 
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for ;me and my 
colleagues. There after I and my colleagues will visit your country for 
disbursement accoding to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where in 
the money will be remitted .

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this 
transaction  is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of 
fear as all required arrangements have been made for the transfer .

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully,

DR ALI IBRAHIM.
Bill and Exchange Manager,
African Development Bank ADB .
