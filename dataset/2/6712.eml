My Husband was falsely accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor killed him. You can verify this from some of the international newspapers posted in the web sites below:

Before my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5 million through a diplomatic means, and deposited it with a Security Company Abroad. And this money was meant for importation of agricultural machineries.

All that is needed is for my lawyer to instruct the company to transfer the funds to your account, I will remunerate you with 20% at the end, but most of all is that I solicit your trust and honesty in this transaction. I have been confined only to our country home and all my calls are monitored, so I will advise you contact my private Attorney Barr.
