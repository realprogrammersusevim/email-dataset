Dear Sir/Madam, 

May I crave your indulgence to open this business discussion with you by an =
informal letter of this sort. It 
is pertinent that a business of this magnitude should have commenced properly =
with a formal meeting 
between you and us to enable both parties know ourselves, have a fore =
knowledge of the nature of the 
business, discuss and acquaint ourselves with the responsibilities and =
functions of both parties and 
appropriate shares accordingly.

I am Dan Wilson Branch Manager of Kenya Commercial Bank in Kenya.This is an =
urgent and very 
confidential business proposition. 

On June 6, 2001,a Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the Kenya Ministry =
Of Energy, 
Mr.Clifford Stone made a numbered time(Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar =
months, valued at 
US$21,500,000.00,(Twenty-One Million, five hundred thousand Dollars) in my =
branch. 
Upon maturity,I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got =
no reply. After a month,we 
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers,the =
National Petroleum 
Corporation that Mr.Clifford Stone died from an automobile accident. 

On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL,and =
all attempts to trace his next 
of kin was fruitless. 

I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr.Clifford Stone =
did not declare any kin or 
relations in all his official documents,including his Bank Deposit paperwork =
in my Bank. This sum of 
US$21,500,000.00 has carefully been fixed in my bank for safekeeping. No one =
will ever come forward 
to claim it. According to South African Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) =
years, the money will revert to the 
ownership of the Government if nobody applies to claim the fund. 

Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a Foreigner to stand in =
as the owner of the money 
which was fixed deposited in my bank. I am writing you because I as a public =
servant,i cannot operate a 
foreign account. 

I want to present you as the owner of the funds so you can be able to claim =
them with the help of my 
attorney. This is simple.I will like you to provide immediately your =
telephone number,full names and 
address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents which will =
put you in place as the 
beneficiary of the funds. 

The money will be moved out for us to share in the ratio of 80% for me and =
20% for you.The paperwork 
for this transaction will be done by the Attorney and this will guarantees =
the successful execution of this 
transaction. 

If you are interested, please reply immediately via my email and Upon your =
response,I shall then provide 
you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand =
the transaction. 

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this =
transaction would be most profitable 
for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in =
real estate within your country. 

Due to the nature of confidentiality in this Transaction our communication =
can only be via email and fax 
mostly. 

Awaiting your urgent reply via my private email:


Thanks and my regards. 

Dan Wilson 
Branch Manager 
Kenya Commercial Bank
