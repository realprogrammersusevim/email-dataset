Sorry to contact you in this manner. Difficulties encountered in efforts
 to secure funds inherited from my fathers business reserve, necessitate
 this search for someone to assist me.
My name is Mohammed Abacha, the heir of the abacha family, and son to 
Sani Abacha, the Late Nigerian Head of State. I am presently undergoing 
trial in Abuja though have just been recently granted bail under the 
condition that my family refunds to the Federal Government some money 
held in accounts in Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Jersey and in Switzerland.
 In return, all criminal proceedings against members of my family be 
dropped ( a deal which was brokered by the international community).
To save the family from total bankruptcy I have managed to ship through 
a courier company, the sum of US$12, 000,000.00, kept by my late father.
 This money has become the only inherited property of our family since  
the government and its loyalists are bent on making life difficult for 
us by freezing all the family account and has auctioned most of our 
properties.

The money has since been deposited with a private finance and
security firm in Europe. I am willing to offer a percentage agreeable to
 you. All other information required to secure the funds will be given 
to you pending a positive response.
A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers will be highly 
appreciated.

Sincerely yours

Mohammed Abacha
