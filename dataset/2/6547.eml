Dear Sir/madam,

 It is with trust and believe that I write to you. I am
 BarristerEDWARD SMITH, a Solicitor at Law. I am the
 personal attorney to  william cole a National of
 your Country, who used to work with Shell Development
 Company here in Nigeria

 On the 21st of April 2001, my client, his wife and
 their only daughter were involved in a car accident
 along apongbon express road ogun state. All occupants of
 the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives. Since then
 I have made several enquiries to locate any of my
 clients extended relatives, this hasalso proved
 unsuccessful.

 After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided
 to track his last name over the Internet, to locate
 any member of his family hence I contacted you. I have
 contacted you to assist in recovering the fund valued
 at US$15.4 Million left behind by my client before it
 gets confisicated or declared unserviceable by the
 Security Finance Firm where this huge amount were
 deposited.

 The said Security Finance Company has issued me a
 notice to provide the Next of Kin or have the account
 confisicated within the next twenty one official
 working days. Since I have been unsuccesfull in
 locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek
 the consent to present you as the Next of Kin to the
 deceased since you bear his last names, so that the
 proceeds of this account can be paid to you.

 Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we
 shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities
 for transfer. I have all necessary information and
 legal documents needed to back you up for claim. All I
 require from you is your honest cooperation to enable
 us see this transaction through. I guarantee you that
 this will be executed under legitimate arrangement
 that will protect you from any breach of the law.

 I would be grateful if this mail will be favoured with
 an early reply.

 Best regards,

 Barr. EDWARD SMITH
