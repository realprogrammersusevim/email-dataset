STRONGHEALTHCARESECTORGROWTH 
              Most investors desire to be in a stock from the beginning 
              of its growth, IBXG is one of those opportunities. 
              Revenues to increase over 500 % 
              to over $18 Million from $3 Million with its 
              pending acquisition of 47 physical therapy outpatient centers and 
              institutional pharmacy businesses, currently owned by CyberCare, 
              Inc. IBXG also just announced a national alliance 
              with Patient-Pay.com 
              that will enable IBXG to market its services on a 
              national scale. We believe the potential is enormous for this expanding 
              dynamic Health Care Information Technology Company.

              GROSSDOMESTICPRODUCT While inflation 
              in the US has been around 2% per year, the US Health Cares 
              inflationary rate rose over 11% per year. Health care costs are 
              spiraling out of control. IBXG provides technology 
              based products and services in full compliance with newly mandated 
              government requirements (HIPAA), that help medical professionals 
              save time and money, by utilizing IBXGs state of the 
              art systems.

UNDERSTANDINGHIPAA 
              The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 
              (PublicLaw104-191), 
              also known as HIPAA, was enacted as part of a broad Congressional 
              attempt at incremental healthcare reform. Part of the law requires 
              the US Dept. of Health and Human Services (DHHS) to develop standards 
              and requirements for maintenance and transmission of health information 
              that identifies individual patients. The requirements outlined by 
              the law are far-reaching for all healthcare organizations that maintain 
              or transmit electronic health information must comply. IBXG 
              offers all health care providers with a viable, already in place 
              solution to HIPAA compliance.
