    DEAR PARTNER.
I am  Sabastian Gomez. an auditor and accountant with a bank here in Afic=
a
Nigeria precisely.
There is a fixed deposit of =A315,000,000.00 ( Fifteen Million Pounds Sta=
rling)
made to this bank since 1994 which is ten years now and since
then no claim or withdrawal have been made on this
deposit. Fortunately, I have been the person working on
the interest from the day of deposit to date. The
interesting part of it is that the fixed deposit
belongs to the late John Hughe a forigner, a civil engineer by profession=
.this
means that the account may have been
abandoned by the surviving family members or that they
are not even aware of the existence of the deposit.
 


However, I just finished updating the interest of the
deposit this october, and it has come up to
=A337,000,000.00 at the 3% interest rate per annum. It
is this interest that I am interested in because I
know very well that the family will care less on what
happens to the interest if they  want to redeem the
deposit, they will be interested on the main money,
that is if they are able to claim it at all because all
the money lodged into different banks here in Arica are now been claimed
by the Nigerian government.


Meanwhile, my plan is to withdraw just some amount
from the accumulated interest and transfer it to a foreign account. which=

will not even
affect the main fixed deposit. I will give you the
details of procedure and my full ID when I receive
your reply and indication of partner. Your reward and
amount to withdraw will be our mutual agreement to
avoid any misunderstanding.

We have noting to lose, we only courage to do this. 

Sincerely yours,

BANK AUDITOR.
SABASTIAN.
