 FROM: DIAKA TSHOMBE 
 
 DEAR FRIEND, 
 
 MY GREETINGS TO YOU AND YOUR FAMILY AND I HOPE THIS 
 LETTER MEETS YOU IN GOOD HEALTH. I AM DIAKA TSHOMBE, 
 AIDE  TO THE LATE PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF 
 ZAIRE NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO 
 (DRC).  I AM WRITING TO YOU IN GOOD FAITH BASED ON YOUR 
 PROFILE I RECEIVED FROM THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN 
 NIGERIA. 
 
 I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER IN CONFIDENCE 
 CONSIDERING MY PRSENT CIRCUMSTANCE AND SITUATION AS 
 A  WAR REFUGEE HERE IN NIGERIA. FEW WEEKS BEFORE 
 THE LATE  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER,  I WAS  INSTRUCTED BY HIM TO MAKE AVAILABLE THE SUM OF 
 US$22MILLION WHICH WAS TO BE TRANSFERRED ABROAD AND 
 LODGED WITH A SECURITY COMPANY FOR SAFEKEEPING 
 DISCLOSED AS FAMILY VALUABLES IN MY NAME PENDING 
 FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS. TWO WEEKS LATER ON MAY 16 
 1997,  PRESIDENT MOBUTU SESE-SEKO GAVE UP POWER TO THE 
 REBELS  LED BY LAURENT KABILA, WHO WERE ADVANCING FROM 
 KISINGANI AND FLED TO TOGO FROM WHERE HE LATER MOVED 
 TO MOROCCO WHERE HE DIED ON SEPTEMBER 7, 1997 LESS 
 THAN FOUR MONTHS AFTER HE WAS FORCED OUT OF POWER. 
 HE  WAS AGED 66 YEARS. I MANAGED TO ESCAPE TO NIGERIA WITH  MY SON PATRICE, AGED 17 WHERE I AM PRESENTLY  RESIDING AS A  WAR REFUGEE SHORTLY AFTER THE CAPITAL CITY   KINSHASHA WAS OVER RUN OVER BY REBELS. I LOST MY  WIFE  AND MY TWO CHILDREN, AND ALL MY POSSESSIONS DURING  THE  REBEL ONSLAUGHT ON THE CAPITAL CITY. 
 
 THE LATE MOBUTU SESE-SEKO DURING HIS 30 YEAR RULE 
 AMASSED A PERSONAL FORTUNE OF US$8BILLION WITH 
 HOUSES  IN SWITZERLAND AND FRANCE. HOWEVER, THE INCUMBENT 
 PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA MADE ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE 
 SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO 
 FREEZE ALL HIS ASSETS AND CONFISCATE HIS PROPERTIES. 
 I  THUS DECIDED TO LIE LOW IN AFRICA TO STUDY THE 
 SITUATION, UNTIL WHEN THINGS GET BETTER LIKE NOW 
 THAT  PRESIDENT LAURENT KABILA IS DEAD AND HIS SON JOSEPH 
 KABILA HAS TAKEN OVER. 
 
 I HAVE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH THE SECURITY COMPANY 
 ABROAD  WHERE THE MONEY IS STILL LODGED AS FAMILY VALUABLES. 
 THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
 KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
 INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST ME BY 
 RECEIVING THE MONEY ON MY BEHALF. ACKNOWLEDGE THIS 
 MESSAGE SO THAT I CAN GIVE YOU THE MODALITIES FOR 
 THE  CLAIM OF THE FUNDS. MAY I AT THIS POINT EMPHASIZE 
 THE  HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENTIALITY WHICH THIS BUSINESS 
 DEMANDS, AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND 
 CONFIDENCE WHCH I HAVE REPOSED IN YOU. 
 
 IF YOU WANT TO ASSIST, I SHALL PUT YOU IN THE 
 PICTURE  OF THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE 
 CURRENTLY BEIGN MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER 
 MODALITIES INCLUDING REMUNERATION FOR YOUR SERVICES. 
 I  AM WILLING TO GIVE YOU A REASONABLE PERCENTAGE OF 
 THE  MONEY AS SOON AS THE TRANSACTION IS CONCLUDED. 
 
 FOR THIS REASON, KINDLY FURNISH ME YOUR CONTACT 
 INFORMATION, WHICH IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE AND 
 FAX  NUMBERS FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND ACKNOWLEDGE 
 RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS. 
 
 YOURS SINCERELY, 
 
 DIAKA TSHOMBE.
