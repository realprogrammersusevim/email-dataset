Attention:

Dear Sir/Madam,
CONTACT : mailto:jawilliams@o2.pl

Please permit me to introduce my humble self to you,
I'm Mr.JAMES WILLIAMS, I am the Manager of
International Relation with Barclays Bank of Ghana
Limited, I 'm 48yrs old, I got your email address on
The Internet and my confidence reposed on you.

Hope you read this Message carefully and reply me
immediately.

Although we have not met before, but I
suggest that this transaction will bring us together.

My dear, we have a customer, a foreigner but base here
in Ghana, his Name is Mr. kwme kuffo.

He is from Atlanta Georgia, but base here with his wife and his
two children, Mr.kwme kuffo has being banking with our
bank for the past 2yrs, some time MARCH 2004,
Mr.kwme kuffowas on his way to his house, and
unfortunately, Mr.kwme kuffo ran into a Trailer load of
Groundnut Oil, and died immediately, their car got
burnt, No single soul was saved, Mr. kwme kuffo
and his entire family was confirmed died.

My Board Directors and Board Management of Barclays Bank of Ghana
has mandated and instructed me to look for
Mr.kwme kuffo relation/relatives and his next of Kin
to come and claim Mr. kwme kuffo Fund, Since MARCH
2004 till date, I have been looking for Mr. kwme kuffo
relation's and relatives/Next of Kin to come and claim
Mr. kwme kuffo Fund which he Deposited with our bank,
I have contacted his Embassy and after 3days, his
Ambassador told me that Mr. kwme kuffo has no relation
and no next of kin, their Ambassador told me that
Mr.kwme kuffo used his first son as his next of kin, but it
is quite unfortunate that Mr. kwme kuffo died with all
his family members.

The reason why I contacted you is
thus, Mr. kwme kuffo is dead, and his only son whom
supposed to inherit his properties and money also,
died with him.

As at this moment, nobody or Person[s]
is coming to claim this money from our bank.

The board directors and management of our bank has told me
that if nobody or person[s] apply for the claim of Mr.
kwme kuffo Fund, the bank will return Mr. kwme kuffo
Fund into our Federal Reserve.

In the Light of the above, I want you to stand as the
Relation/relative of
Late Mr. kwme kuffo; I want you to act as the kwme kuffo
Brother, so that you will inherit Mr. kwme kuffon Money
which he deposited with our bank, it might interest
you to know that Mr. kwme kuffo has a Domiciliary Bank
Account with our Bank and he has a total sum of
US$9.2M Nine Million Two Hundred Dollars, this is the
exact amount which late Mr. kwme kuffo has in his
domiciliary Account, and this money is still in his
account as unclaimed money.

This transaction is very easy and simple, and it is
100% risk free, I'm the
Manager for International Relations with Barclays Bank of Ghana Limited, and 
the Management and Board
Directors of the Bank are waiting for me to provide to
them the Relation or next of Kin to late Mr. kwme kuffo,
of which I told them that I am still searching the
next of kin to the deceased.

Finally, if you are interested with this transaction, I will front you to 
the bank as the only next of kin to late Mr. kwme kuffo,
and I will let the bank know that you are the only
right person to inherit late Mr. kwme kuffon Funds and
properties.

If you agree with me, I will present you
to my bank as the rightful person/next of kin to Late
Mr. kwme kuffo, and all Mr. kwme kuffo Properties and his
Money US$9.2M Nine Million Two Hundred Thousand
Dollars will be Transferred into your own Account as
Mr. kwme kuffo next of kin.

If you are interested, just email me. If you are
interested, late Mr. kwme kuffo Funds will be credited
into your Account.

So reply me immediately and let me know what you say.

Feel free to ask any questions.

We will share Late Mr. kwme kuffo Funds 50-50; you will
take 50% of the US$9.2M. Which is US$4.600, 000.00
Four Million Six Hundred Thousand Dollars, while the
Balance of the same amount will be mine.

I will be waiting for your immediate response,

Thanks and have a nice day.

With immense regards,

JAMES WILLIAMS
