Dear Sir/Madam,

In order to transfer from a Bank some amount of money, I have the courage to 
look for a reliable and honest person who will be capable for this important 
business believing that you will never let me down either now or in the 
future.

My name is Mr. Issa Juma, and I work in the International operation 
department in a Local Bank
here in South Africa. On a routine inspection I discovered a dormant 
domiciliary account with a BAL. O f 26,000,000 (Twenty Six Million USD) on 
further discreet investigation, I also discovered that the account holder 
has long since passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the account. The 
bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the former operator of 
the a/c is a foreigner and from Iraq in particular and I am certainly sure 
that he is dead, and nobody will come again for the claim of this money A 
foreigner can only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder; 
therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction.

I will provide the necessary information needed in order to claim this 
money, But you will need to open an account where this can be transferred. 
If interested send your private Telephone No. And Fax number including full 
details of the account to be used for the Deposit I wish for utmost
confidentiality in handling this transaction as my job and the future of my 
family would be jeopar dized if it were breached. The informationswill be as 
follows.......

Bank Name:.........
Bank Address:........
Account Name:............
Account Number:.............
Swift Code No:................
Routing Number:..................

I want to assure you that the transaction is without risk if due process is 
followed accordingly. Finally I will give you 25% for your corporation. I 
look forward to a favorable response from you. through my email: 
alpha2@africamail.com

Best Regards,
Mr. Issa Juma.
