                         ("REMITTANCE OF $15 MILLION U.S.A DOLLARS
                                   CONFIDENTIAL IS THE CASE")


Compliments Of The Season 2006,

     Forgive my indignation if this message comes to you as a surprise and
may offend your personality for contacting you without your prior consent 
and
writing through this channel.I got your contact from the proffesional data 
base
found in the internet Yahoo tourist search.When i was searching for a 
foreign reliable partner.I assured of your capability and reliability to 
champion this businees opportunity.

     After series of prayers/fasting.i was divinely directed to contact you
among other names found in the data base Yahoo tourist search.I believe that 
God has a way of helping who is in need.

   I am (Godwin Amiri Esq),the Head of file Department in African developent 
bank (ADB).

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A 
dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account that belongs to one 
of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in (Monday 
31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, 
we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money 
because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin 
or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines, but 
unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died 
alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. 
It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department 
now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to 
you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent 
disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we dont want this money to 
go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, and a 
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of 
this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the provision 
of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses incured during the 
business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There after i will 
visit your country for disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, 
you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private telephone 
and fax number for easy and effective communication and location where the 
money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax 
or email the text of the application I will not fail to bring to your notice 
that this transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any 
atom of fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.

You should contact me on my number 00226-7885 75 97 immediately as soon as 
you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours faithfully,

Godwin Amiri  (Esq.)
FROM (ADB) OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.
GOD BLESSINGS,PROTECTIONS AND GUIDIANCE TO YOUR ENTIRE FAMILY.

POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to 
move very
