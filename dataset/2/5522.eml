FROM THE DESK OF DR AMAMAN LAZARE 
AUDITING DEPARTMENT 
BANK OF AFRICA. 
ABIDJAN - COTE D'IVOIRE. 

Urgent Attention, 

I have a proposal for you, this however is not mandatory nor will I in any
manner compel you to honour against your will. I am Dr Amaman Lazare, and
work with a bank (one of the African leading banks in the West Coast). Here
in this bank existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which belong to
a American national who is now late Mr Morris Thompson who died on Alaska
Airlines Flight 261.

STATUS & NATURE OF TRANSACTION: 

When I discovered that there had been no deposits nor withdrawals from this
account for this long period, I decided to carry out a system investigation
and discovered that non of the family member nor relations of the late
person is aware of this account. This is the story in a nutshell. Now I
want an account overseas where the bank will transfer this
funds.Thereafter,I had planned to destroy all related documents for this
account. It is a careful network and for the past eleven months I have
worked out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation. 

The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all the accumulated
interest the balance in this account stands at-(US$14 million US dollars).

Now our questions are:- 

1. Can you handle this project? 

2. Can I give you this trust? 

3. What will be your commission? If you can sponsor this transfer. 

Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible. Finally, it is our
humble prayer that the information as contained herein be accorded the
necessary attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves. I Expect
your urgent response if you can handle this project. 

I am expecting your urgent response as soon as you receive my message.
Kindly send any message through my alternative email addresses below for
security measures thus; laz_amaman@hotmail.com 
Respectfully yours, 
Dr Amaman Lazare.
