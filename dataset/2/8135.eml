Gooday Sir/Madam,

I am Luis Tasharofi  Jnr. I am a collage student of London School of
Economics, U.K. I am compelled to contact you concerning a business
deal,which I believe will be beneficial to you and I.  My father, His
Excellency, Ambassador Krikor Tasharofi was a diplomat. In his lifetime, he 
was an Ambassador emeritus. While in office, he was highly connected because 
of his expertise in transferring money to coded accounts for important 
Clients at short notices and without detection. Due to his  connections in 
high places, at the end of his tenure as an Ambassador, he became acquainted 
with important African leaders, politicians etc who  patronized him to help 
them transfer money out of Africa and this he did with relative ease.

I was quite close to him and was privy to his business deals because he
used to confide in me. I was also aware of his numerous trips to Europe
and theAmericas to make large cash deposits in several Banks. Recently, my 
father came to England en route Liechtenstein to make large cash deposits 
for one of his clients. We met on July 6th, 2005 at his hotel room and on 
July 7th, 2005, I learnt that he was one of the victims of the London Terror 
attack.

After the recovery of his body, I and my other  siblings were making
arrangements for his burial when on July 27th, 2005,one of the
Embassys staff contacted me and informed me that my late father  took him 
into confidence and told him of some boxes kept at the Embassys storage 
house. The Staff also informed me that now that my father was dead,  he had 
no option than to hand the boxes over to me.

Upon collecting the boxes, I opened it and to my surprise, it contains
large sum of money to the Value of US$84 Million US Dollars. I quickly
close theboxes and left it there as the embassy storage house did not know 
what is  the content in the boxes. My problem now is how to move this money 
out ofthe U.K. into a designated Bank account. I have tried to use my late  
fathers old routes to transfer it but met a brick wall and that is why 
Ihave decided to seek for external assistance in the matter.

I can assure you that this business is 100% risk free, as my late
fathers Clients who owns the money would never suspect that I am involved. 
For your assistance I will offer you 20% of the total sum, for your 
assistance so please get back to me as soon as possible to enable me give 
you the details on how we are going to proceed.

1: Full name

2:Direct telephone number and fax

3:An identification of you such as international passport /drivers
license

I eagerly await your urgent response to my private
email.tasharofi-jnr@hotmail.com

Yours truly,

Luis Tasharofi JNR.
