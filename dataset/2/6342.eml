Greetings from Mrs. M. Abacha,

l am sorry for the embarrassment this my letter might cause you as we have =
not had any correspondence before this letter. I got your contact address t=
hrough your country's embassy and high commissions here in Lagos Nigeria,du=
ring my research for a reliable and trustworthy foreign partner who i will =
do business with, though l did not disclose the nature of the business l in=
tend to do with whoever they will recommend for me for security reasons.=20

I am MRS MARIAM ABACHA (A Moslem), wife and the widow of the late Nigeria M=
ilitary Head of State, Late General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th of June=
, 1998 while still on active duty. l am contacting you in view of the fact =
that we will be of great assistance to each other likeness developing a cor=
dial business relationship.

l currently have within my reach the sum of Twelve Million US Dollars (US$1=
2,000,000.00) cash which l intend to use for investment purposes, like Real=
 Estates Development specifically in your country. This money came as a pay=
back contract deal between my late husband and a Russian Firm on our countr=
ies multi-billion dollars Ajaokuta Steel Plant.  The Russian Partners retur=
ned my husband's share of  USD$12,000,000.00 after the death of my husband =
and lodged in my husband's security company of which l a director. Right no=
w, the new Civilian Government headed by president olusegun obasanjo have i=
ntensified their probe on my husband's financial and oil company. In view o=
f these, l acted fast to withdraw this US$12,000,000.00 from our  company's=
 vault and deposited it with another Security Company for safe keeping. l h=
ave since declared our Security Company bankrupt. No record ever existedcon=
cerning the money traceable by the government because  there is no document=
ation showing that we received this money from our Russian business partner=
s.

Due to the current situation in the country concerning government attitude =
towards my family, it has become quite impossible for me to make use of thi=
s money within. Let me refer you to the front page of (BBC World News of 12=
th August & 4th September 2000). You can check it through their contact web=
site at
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_909000/909972.stm
and
http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/world/africa/newsid_877000/877113.stm

The present civilian government in Nigeria had seized and frozen all our ba=
nk accounts both here in Nigeria and abroad. Thus consent l shall expect yo=
u to contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail about this transact=
ion. Bearing in mind that your assistance is highly needed in proceeding to=
 the Security Company and claim this fund for onward invesment in your coun=
try. l proposed a percentage of 30% of the total sum to you for the expecte=
d service and assistance, 5% for offsetting all minor expenses incurred in =
the course of this Transaction. Your urgent response is highly needed as to=
 stop all further contacts.=20

All correspondence must be by my private email address above. I will give y=
ou my particulars including my personal picture for you to know me very cle=
arly when l hear from you. I must use this opportunity to implore you to ex=
ercise the utmost indulgence and keep this matter extra ordinarily confiden=
tial whatever your decision while awaits your prompt response. I will also =
scan and send to you a copy of my photograph for your record keeping. Pls N=
ote that some times to come,You might receive some messages that looks like=
 this but you don't need to respond back to such messages because they are =
ikely to be our family enemies and impersonators who are trying to know the=
 current  financial strenght of my late husband. (Sani Abacha).

NB: Because of the security being mounted on the members of my family by th=
e present civilian government headed by president olusegun obasanjo, l have=
 decided that this transaction transaction will exist between you and my fa=
mily Attorney and also my son,Abba Abacha, Therefore you can contact my son=
 through our contact telephone numbers at: 234-80-33464921. Remember to inc=
lude your private telephone, fax and mobile numbers for easy communication.=
