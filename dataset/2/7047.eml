My Dear Friend,
I got your contact through a desperate and personal search on the web for =
someone I could really trust as I have prayed over it and I wish to express =
my interest to handle this matter with you as Ibelieve that you are reliable =
in handling these type of international transaction.

Though we have not met before but I believe one has to risk confiding in =
someone to succeed sometimes in life but however is not mandatory or in any =
manner compel you to Honor against your will.

Although I am not suppose to contact you through email but it is because of =
the confidential nature of this transaction please bear with me

I am Ms Nasrinn N.Farooq, a top bank official in the National Bank of =
Dubai,(UNITED ARAB EMIRATES).

I am writing this letter to ask for your support and co-operation to carry =
out this business opportunity in my department.

On June 6, 1999,an Oil consultant/contractor with Dubai Petroleum =
Corporation, MR DAVID AMEERALY, made a numbered time(fixed)deposit for twelve =
calendar months,Valued at US$16,500, 000.00 (sixteen Million Five Hundred =
Thousand Dollars) in my branch. upon maturity I sent a routine notification =
to his forwarding address but got no reply.

After a month,we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract =
employers,the Dubai Petroleum Corporation that MR DAVID AMEERALY, died in the =
plane crash On October 31,1999,(an Egyptian Boeing767Flight 990) with other =
passengers on board as you can confirm it yourself via the website below:
http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/1999/11/01/iran/main49778.shtml

On further investigation,I found out that he died without making a WILL and =
attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless .I therefore made further =
investigation and discovered that MR DAVID AMEERALY,did not declare any next =
of kin or relations in all his official documents,including his bank deposit =
paperwork in my bank.

This sum of US$16,500, 000.00 and the interest is being rolled over with the =
principal sum at the end of each year.No one will ever come forward to claim =
it and according to UNITED ARAB EMIRATES LAW,at the expiration of(Ten) =
years,the money will revert to the ownership of the UNITED ARAB EMIRATES =
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

My proposal is that I will like you to stand as the next of kin to MR DAVID =
AMEERALY, so that the fruit of this old man labour will not get into the =
hands of some corrupt Government officials.This is simple, I will like you to =
provide immediately your full name and address so that I can forward to you =
the contact of our bank Attorney for preparing the necessary documents and =
affidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin.

Any bank account in any part of the world,which you will provide,will then =
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary/next of kin.

The money will be paid into your account for us to share in ratio of  45% for =
me and 45% for you and 10 % will be set aside for expenses in cured during =
the business.There is no risk at all.

The paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my =
position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of  this =
transaction.

If you are interested,please reply immediately and upon your responses,I =
shall provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you =
understand the transaction.

Please observe utmost confidentiality and be rest assured that this =
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require =
your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Please upon the receipt of this mail message,send to me the following below =
to enable me start the processing of the transfer,

1.Your Full Name
2.Your House Address.
3.Your Phone Number and Fax,

Thank You And God Bless You.

Sincerely,

Ms Nasrinn N.Farooq
