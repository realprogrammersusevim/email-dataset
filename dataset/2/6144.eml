Good=20
Day,

Please accept my sincere apologizes if my email does not meet=20
your business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as Mr.=20
Barry Henry, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known=20
bank, here in London, England.

One of our accounts, with holding=20
balance of =C2=A315,000,000 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) has been=20
dormant and last operated three years ago. From my investigations and=20
confirmation, the owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John=20
Shumejda died on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in=20
Birmingham; you can view this CNN website

http://edition.cnn.
com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/

for details on the crash.

Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this=20
money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the=20
existence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from=20
the National Immigration also states that he was single on entry into=20
the UK.

I have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank=20
officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal=20
with. We therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the=20
next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you=20
after necessary processes have been followed.

This transaction is=20
totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does=20
not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal=20
act.

On your interest, let me hear from you.

Warm Regards,

Mr. Barry=20
Henry.
