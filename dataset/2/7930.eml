Dear Friend
This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I=20
believe it is only a day that people meet and become great friends and=20
business partners.=20

I am Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of=20
Corporate affairs with a reputable bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write=20
you this proposal in good faith, believing that I can trust you with=20
the information I am about to reveal to you.

I have an urgent and very=20
confidential business proposition for you. On November 6, 2000, an=20
Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON PETROLEUM=20
CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36=20
calendar months, valued at  US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five=20
hundred Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his=20
account officer before I was moved to my present position recently.

=20
Upon maturity in 2003, as his account officer and as well the bank=20
manger, it is my duty to notify him on the maturity date so I sent a=20
routine notification to his forwarding address but the letter was=20
returned undelivered.=20

After sometime, I tried sending back the=20
letter, but it was again returned and finally I discovered from his=20
contract employers, Chevron Petroleum Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al=20
Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand of Saddam Hussein=20
(former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his country Iraq,=20
as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On further=20
investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser=E2=80=99s family wife and tw=
o=20
sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not=20
declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents,=20
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any=20
WILL. This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under=20
dormant/unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have=20
heard from the owner since 2003.

 I wish to let you know that all the=20
investigation I have made so far, my bank management is not aware of=20
it, I am the only one that have the information.
With the recent change=20
of government in my country and with their efforts to support the=20
United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By end of=20
this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which=20
will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of=20
above $5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it=20
is not for terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the=20
country immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely=20
confiscate the money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner=20
to explain the source of the money. I cannot directly transfer out this=20
money without the help of a foreigner and that is why I am contacting=20
you for an assistance.

 As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser,=20
coupled with my present position and status in the bank as Head of=20
Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of the=20
funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account,=20
with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give=20
you. All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully=20
worked out and there is practically no risk involved, the transaction=20
will be executed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you=20
from any breach of law, beside U. A. E is porous and anything goes.

If=20
you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to=20
share the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied.=20
If you are interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message=20
so we can go over the details. Thanking you in advance and may God=20
bless you.=20

Please, treat with utmost confidentiality. I shall send=20
you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when the=20
deposit was made for your perusal.=20
