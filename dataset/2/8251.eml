My name is MR YARO BAMIYI=2C the eldest son of Rtd
General
BUBA S=2EG=2EBAMIYI=2C who was the estwhile Minister
of the Federal Capital territory Abuja in thelate
General Sani Abachas Regime of 1993-1998=2EI am
contacting you in a benevolent spirit=3B utmost
confidence and trust to enable us provide a solution
to a money transfer of $25M that is presently putting
my entire family into great disarray=2E 

You may be quite surprised at my sudden contact to you
but do not despair=2C I got your contact from a business
site on the internet and following the information I
gathered about you=2C I was convinced that you could be
of assistance to me=2E So=2CI decided to contact you at
once due to the urgency required for us to immediately
transfer the said funds out of the country=2E

During the time my father was in the government with
the late General Sani Abacha as the head of state=2Cthey
were both involved in several deals that yielded
Billions of Dollars=2E The prominent amongst the deals
was monies that emanated from funds set aside for the
importation of Arms and Ammunitions to boost the
Nigerian Defense=2C funds set to embark on an oversea
ampaign to counter the United States action to put a
stop to the self succession bid of the Abacha
government to retain power=2C and monies set aside to
rehabilitate the ailing Nigerian Petroleum Refineries
and the National Electric Power Authority which
supplies Electricity to the entire nation=2E If you are
conversant with world news=2C you would understand
better=2E

During this period my father was able to make some
good money for himself and kept in his private bank
accounts=2E The then head of state General Sani Abacha
transferred his share of the money through a Lebanese
businessman=2C Chagoury and a Jewish businessman=2C Mark
Rissar to bank accounts overseas=2E Unfortunately=2C all
the secrets were revealed by the investigation
agencies set up by the successive governments and most
of the Abacha=3Fs loots were traced and repatriated
fromthe various accounts to the Federal Government
Treasury=2E

Out of the money my father made=2C he left the sum of
N50 Million =28Fifty Million Naira=29 in the CBN escrow
account for further transfer into a foreign account
and a sum of $25M =28TWENTY-FIVE Million Dollars=29 was
kept in a Private security firm here in Nigeria=2E
Through the confessions made by the Abacha=3Fs Family=2C
the N50 Million was recovered by the investigating
agency from the CBN escrow account=2E But were unable to
discover the $25M=2C which he kept in the vaults=2E The
reason is because no names were used to lodge in the
funds=2EInstead=2C he used PERSONAL IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS
=28PIN=29 and declared the contents as Bearer Bonds and
Treasury Bills=2E Also the firm issued him with a
certificate of deposit of the consignments=2E Note thatI
have these information in my custody=2E

Right now=2C my father has been arrested and detained
for interrogation=2E As the eldest son of my Father=2C I
believe that I owe the entire family an obligation to
ensure that the $25M is successfully transferred
abroad for investment purposes=2E With the present
situation=2C I cannot do it all by myself=2E 

It is based on this that I am making this contact with
you=2E I have done a thorough homework and fine-tuned
the best wayto create you as the beneficiary to the
funds and effect the transfer accordingly=2E Is rest
assured that the modalities I have resolved to
finalize the entire project guarantees our safety and
the successful transfer of the funds=2E So=2C you will be
absolutely right when you say that this project is
risk free and viable=2E If you are capable and willing
to assist=2Ccontact me at once via email for more
details=2E

Believe me=2C there is no one else we can trust gain=2EAll
my fathers friends have deserted us after exploiting
us on the pretence of trying to help my father=2E As it
is said=2C =22it is at the time of problems that you know
your true friends=22=2E So long as you keep everything to
yourself=2C we would definitely have no problems=2E For
your assistance=2C I am ready to give you as much as 20%
of the total funds after transfer and invest a
reasonable percentage into any viable business you may
suggest=2E

asource of up liftment to you also=2E You have
absolutely nothing to loose in assisting us
