DEAR,

I AM THE DIRECTOR OF BILLS AND EXCHANGE AT THE FOREIGN 
REMITTANCE DEPARTMENT OF OUR BANK HERE IN ABIDJAN COTE 
D=92IVOIRE.

IN MY DEPARTMENT WE DISCOVERED AN ABANDONED SUM OF 
US$12.500,000.00 (TWELEVE. FIVE MILLION USD ONLY) IN AN 
ACCOUNT THAT BELONGS TO ONE OF OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS WHO 
DIED ALONG WITH HIS ENTIRE FAMILY IN NOVEMBER 1999 IN A 
PLANE CRASH.

SINCE WE GOT INFORMATION ABOUT HIS DEATH, WE HAVE BEEN 
EXPECTING HIS NEXT OF KIN TO COME OVER AND CLAIM HIS MONEY 
BECAUSE WE CANNOT RELEASE IT UNLESS SOMEBODY APPLIES FOR IT 
AS NEXT OF KIN OR RELATION TO THE DECEASED AS INDICATED IN 
OUR BANKING GUIDELINES.

UNFORTUNATELY WE LEARNT THAT ALL HIS SUPPOSED NEXT OF KIN 
OR RELATIONS DIED ALONG WITH HIM AT THE PLANE CRASH LEAVING 
NOBODY BEHIND FOR THE CLAIM.

IT IS THEREFORE UPON THIS DISCOVERY THAT I AND ONE OF THE 
OFFICIALS IN THE DEPARTMENT NOW DECIDED TO MAKE BUSINESS 
WITH YOU AND RELEASE THE MONEY TO YOU AS THE NEXT OF KIN OR 
RELATIONS OF THE DECEASED FOR SAFETY AND SUBSEQUENT 
DISBURSEMENT SINCE NOBODY IS COMING FOR IT AND WE DON=92T 
WANT THIS MONEY TO GO DISBURSEMENT ACCOUNT AS UNCLAIMED 
BILL.

THE BANKING LAW AND GUIDELINES HERE STIPULATED THAT IF SUCH 
MONEY REMAINED UNCLAIMED AFTER FOUR YEARS THE MONEY WILL BE 
TRANSFERRED INTO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACCOUNT AS UNCLAIMED 
FUND. THE REQUEST OF A FOREIGNER AS NEXT OF KIN IN THIS 
BUSINESS IS OCCASIONED BY THE FACT THAT THE CUSTOMERS WAS A 
FOREIGNER AND AN IVORIEN CANNOT STAND AS NEXT OF KIN TO A 
FOREIGNER.

WE AGREE THAT 15% OF THIS MONEY WILL BE FOR YOU AS FOREIGN 
PARTNER AND 5% FOR EXPENSES INCURRED DURING THE COURSE OF 
REMITTANCE. THEREAFTER TO THE PERCENTAGES INDICATED.

THEREFORE TO ENABLE THE IMMEDIATE TRANSFER OF THE FUND TO 
YOU AS ARRANGED. YOU MUST APPLY FIRST TO THE BANK AS A 
RELATION OR NEXT OF KIN OF THE DECEASED INDICATING YOUR 
BANK ACCOUNT NUMBER AND LOCATION WHERE IN THE MONEY WILL BE 
REMITTED . UPON RECEIPT OF YOUR REPLY I WILL SEND TO YOU 
THE TEXT OF THE APPLICATION. AS SOON AS YOU RECEIVE THIS 
LETTER, YOU SHOULD CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY AND INDICATE YOUR 
DIRECT AND CONFIDENTIAL TELEPHONE/FAX NUMBERS FOR THE 
EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION REQUIRED.

TRUSTING TO HEAR FROM YOU IMMEDIATELY ON TELEPHONE NUMBER 
0022507822694.

YOURS FAITHFULLY,

F. LAMINE
DIRECTOR, FOREIGN OPERATIONS
