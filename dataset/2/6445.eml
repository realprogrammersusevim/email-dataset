Dearest in the Lord,

Greetings to you and your family, I am Mrs VILLARAN NENITA, from 
Philippines. I am married to Mr. MARIO NENITA who worked with Philippines 
embassy in Ivory Coast for nine years before he died in the year 2002.He is 
also a well known fruits import and Export business man in Ivory Coast. We 
were married for eleven years without a child.

He died after a brief illness that lasted for only four days. Before his 
death we were both born again Christian. Since his death I decided not to 
remarry or get a child outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is 
against. When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of $5.6Million 
US dollars with a bank in Ivory Coast Presently, this money is still in the 
custody of the bank. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would not last for 
the next three months due to cancer problem.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to a church or 
better to a Christian individual or a good Muslim personality that have a 
humanity understanding and trustworthy that will utilize this money the way 
I am going to instruct herein. I want a church or an individual personality 
that  is trustworthy  to use this money for orphanages, widows, propagating 
the word of God and to endeavour that the house of God is maintained. The 
Bible made us to understand that "Blessed is the hand that giveth". I took 
this decision because I don't have any child that will inherit this money 
and my husband relatives are not Christians and I don't want my husband's 
efforts to be used by unbelievers. I don't want a situation where this money 
will be used in an ungodly way. This is why I am taking this decision. I am 
not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am going to 
be in the bosom of the Lord.Exodus 14 VS 14 says that "the Lord will fight 
my case and I shall hold my peace". I don't need any telephone communication 
in this regard because of my health hence the presence of my husband's 
relatives around me always.

I don't want them to know about this development as I am convinced that With 
God by my said, all things are possible. As soon as I receive your reply I 
shall give you the contact of the bank in Ivory Coast, I will also send a 
copy of my passport to you and my photo and also issue you an authority 
letter that will empower you to be the beneficiary of the money. I want you 
and your church to always pray for me because the Lord is my shepherd and he 
shall see us through, My happiness is that I live a life of a worthy 
Christian so I have no fear at all for I am convinced that God is with me 
and he shall be with you if you make yourself available to take up this 
spiritual project of God.

I believe that whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit 
and Truth thus I took this decision. Please always be prayerful all through 
your life. Contact me on this email address always and please be informed 
that any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing another person 
for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as I 
Stated herein.

Hoping to receive your reply.
Remain blessed in the Lord.
Yours in Christ,
MRS VILLARAN NENITA
