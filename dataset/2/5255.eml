Please do not be apprehensive by this mail as I humbly seek YOUR PATIENCE,
UNDERSTANDING and COOPERATION in regard to my below plight. Once again, do
not
be apprehensive considering its magnitude and the fact that we have not
meet before.
I am contacting you in confidence believing that you will not turn down my
humble 
request of you, which I intend for our mutual benefit.

I am Mr. Harrison Bello, an accountant with Fountain Trust Finance House. I
am
the account manager of Mr. Fredrick Coleman, an Australian, who used to be a
civil contractor in Nigeria. In 1999, Mr. Fredrick Coleman was involved in a
car accident along Sagamu express road and unfortunately his live. Since
then I
have made several enquiries through his countrys embassy to locate any
of his extended relatives without successful. 

Hence, I am contacting you to assist in retrieving the money and property
left
behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared unserviceable by
this firm.Mr. Fredrick Colemans an account is valued 18.7 million dollars.
The
company has issued me a notice to provide his next of kin or have the
account
confiscated within the three months. Since I have been unsuccessful in
locating
his relatives for over 4 years now. I am therefore seeking your consent to
present you as the next of kin to the Mr. Coleman so that the proceeds of
this
account can be paid to you.

I intend to use part of this money for investment and charity outreach
while we
shall use part of it for our effort. For your assistance you will be
entitled
to 30% and I 65%. While 5% shall be used to reimburse expenses that might
be incurred 
during the process. I have all necessary data to facilitate success.

All I require is your honest co-operation and support to enable us see this
deal through.
I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
will prevent any
breach of the law.

Please, if its okay with you, get back to me at this email
(hansob@netzero.com) to enable us 
discuss further.

Best regards,
Harrison Bello.
