was executed, commissioned and the contractor was paid his actual cost of=

the contract. Now, we are left with the balance of Twenty  million dollar=

not until the presidential announcement last week, that all foreign contr=
actors
owed be paid forthwith, this will enable the presidency reconcile our deb=
t

bank account, my partner and I will come over to your country to arrange
for our own share and possibly invest part of this  money in your country=
