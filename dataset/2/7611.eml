Good Day.

Let me first of all treat on how I got your email address. I was looking for
someone to go in partnership with in order to achieve an aim, which at the end
of the day will leave both of us extra dollars in our accounts.


Please note that this is no SCAM, but an honest transaction that will
be transacted between two or more reputable personalities.

I am Mr Vincent Soglo, Chief Credit Officer of International Trust House
Benin. There is an account opened in this Firm  in 2002 and since then nobody
has operated on this account again. After going through some old
files in the records i discovered that if i do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.

A vault account of Col Ibrahim Sankoh , with a credit balance of
US$11,300,000.00 dollars.The beneficiary,Col Ibrahim Sankoh , he died, leaving
no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs. For obvious reasons,
i have decided to inherit this very A/C balance following a legitimate
release procedure.

If you are willing to assist me, Please hurry and provide us with your
full names,residence address,occupation,date of birth, and contact Phone
numbers for communication purposes.We have unanimously concluded to release
30% of the total sum to you for your participation.


Please get back to me for detailed discussion.


Truly Yours,
Mr. Vincent Soglo.
