Dear Friend

                                                 Attn: Please
=20
I know this mail might come to you as a surprise package, but kindly allow =
me the opportunity to introduce myself. I am Dr. Idris Adamu. The manager o=
f bill and exchange at the foreign remittance department of my Bank. I got =
your particulars through my private search for a trustworthy foreign Partne=
r. However, I am contacting you in order to ask for your assistance on this=
 confidential business proposal with full financial benefit for both me and=
 you. Before I go into further details, please be informed that I am writin=
g without any other person(s) pre-knowledge of my contacting you on this tr=
ansaction. Therefore I will appreciate same attitude to be maintained by yo=
u all through.=20
=20
In my department I discovered an abandoned sum of US$8.5M, (Eight Million, =
Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) with account number 14-2558-5976 that bel=
ongs to one of our foreign customers who died along with his wife and only =
daughter in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261 which crashe=
d on January 31st 2000. You shall read more about the crash on visiting thi=
s site. http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/The owner of =
this account is Mr. Morris Thompson an American and great industrialist and=
 a resident of Alaska. It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decid=
ed to make this business proposal to you and for our bank to release the mo=
ney to you. You have to follow the instruction which I will be sending to y=
ou as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent=
 disbursement since nobody is coming for it and I don't want this money to =
go into our bank treasury as unclaimed bill.
In appreciation of your assistance, I am offering you 35% of the total sum.=
 5% for contingencies (cost of transfer/other charges) likely to be incurre=
d during the course of transaction, while the remaining 60% is for me. Upon=
 receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the =
application which you will complete and forward to our bank asking for this=
 money to be paid to you as the next of kin to Mr. Morris Thompson.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free=
 and that you should not entertain any fear as all required arrangements ha=
ve been made for the transfer. You should contact me immediately you finish=
 reading this mail via email.=20
=20
I await for your favorable response.
Yours Faithfully,
Dr. Idris Adamu.
