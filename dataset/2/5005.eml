Presently i am suffering from long time cancer of the breast from all indications my condition is really deteriorating because of the unsuitable condition in my country that have denied me proper medical care=2E

Therefore my desire now is to contribute part of this wealth for
humanitarian aid such as propagation in assisting the less-privileged and to use part of the fund to acquire a better medical treatment else where in Europe or America
I am willing to give out 20% of the sum to you for helping me to

the money on your name as the beneficiary=2C only if you promise to use this funds judiciary for the said purpose=2E
