Dear friend,

I am Mr. Alexander_Gedike a personal treasurer to Mikhail Khodorkovsky the 
Richest man in Russia and owner of the following companies: Chairman/CEO: 
YUKOS OIL (Russian's Largest Oil Company), Chairman/CEO: Menatep SBP Bank (A 
well reputable financial institution with its Branches all over the world).

SOURCE OF FUNDS:
I have a profiling amount in an excess of US$35,000,000 which I seek  your  
Partnership in accommodating for me. You will be rewarded with 10% of  the  
total sum for your partnership. Can you be my partner on this?

INTRODUCTION OF MYSELF:
As a personal treasurer to him, authority was handed over to me to transfer 
some money to an American oil merchant for his last oil deal with my boss 
Mikhail Khodorkovsky.

Already the funds have left the shore of Russia to a European private Bank 
where the final crediting is expected to be carried out. While I was on the 
process, My Boss got arrested for his Involvement in politics by financing 
the leading and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, Led 
by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party Led by 
Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses a treat to President Vladimir Putin's Second 
Tenure as Russian president.

You can catch more of the story on this website:

YOUR ROLE:
All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted Sum 
and I will re-profile the funds with your name, which will enable the 
European bank transfer the sum to you with the aid of an online bank in 
London. The transaction has to be Concluded before Mikhail Khodorkovsky is 
out on bail. As Soon as I confirm your readiness to conclude the transaction 
with me, I will provide you with the details.

Please respond to my private email which is:alexandergedike76@yahoo.co.uk


Thank you very much

Regards

Alexander_Gedike (Mr.)
