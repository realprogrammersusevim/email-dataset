 Dear,
 
 RE:TRANSFER OF $30.9MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
 
I am Dr.Kashiff Tijani, Manager, Standard Bank of  South Africa, 
branch  code 00020500, 88 Commissioner Street, Johannesburg, Bauteng, 
South Africa. I have an urgent and very profitable
business proposition 
for you that should be handled with extreme confidentiality.

We want 
to transfer to overseas, the sum of $30.9 million United States Dollars 
from my branch of Standard Bank of South Africa discovered as a 
floating fund by our Auditor General, belonging to our late customer, 
a  consultant and contractor with South African Diamond Corporation, 
(Safdico),who died in testate and without any known next of kin and  
this money may be forfeited to my home government if not claimed or  
moved out of my country.

All that is required of you is to assist in 
the transfer of this fund to your country for safe keeping and 
investment purposes for very adequte consideration, say, 40 percent of 
the entire $30.9million dollars.

Please, feel able to also reply via 
my alternative email address: <drkashifftijani@excite.com>

Warmest 
regards,
