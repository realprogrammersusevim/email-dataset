Good Day

Mr. A.G. Furness

Branch Manager

Bank of Cyprus

London Branch=20

Dear Friend,

I am Mr. A.G Furness The Branch Manager of the Bank of Cyprus, London. I =
have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you.In Dece=
mber, 2001, an American Oil consultant/contractor Mr.Jeffrey Paul Mead ma=
de a numbered time (Fixed) Deposit for Twenty-Four calendar months, value=
d at US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty- five Million Dollars) in my branch.=20

Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address bu=
t got no reply. After some months, we sent a reminder and finally I disco=
vered from his contract employers, that Mr.Jeffrey Paul Mead passed away.=
=20

On further investigation, I found out that he died without making a WILL,=
and all attempts to trace his next of kin was fruitless. I therefore made=
 further investigation and discovered that Mr. Mead did not declare any k=
in or relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit=
 paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$25,000,000.00 is still sitting in m=
y Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at th=
e end of each year.No one has ever come forward to claim it.=20

According to Banking Law, at the expiration of 5 (five) years, the money =
will revert to the ownership of Government if nobody applies to claim the=
 fund. Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you to stand in as t=
he next of kin to Mr.Jeffrey Paul Mead so that the fruits of this old man=
's labour will not get into the hands of some corrupt government official=
s.=20

This is simple, I will like you to provide immediately your full names an=
d address so that the Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and a=
ffidavits which will put you in place as the next of kin. We shall employ=
 the services of two Attorney for drafting and notarization of the WILL a=
nd to obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate/administration=
 in your favour for the

transfer.=20

A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide will then =
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the

beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us =
to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and 10% be used in se=
ttling taxation and all local and foreign expenses.=20

There is no risk at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be=
 done by the Attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees th=
e successful execution of this transaction.=20

If you are interested, please reply immediately to my alternative email a=
ddress above and below and upon your response, I shall then provide you w=
ith more details and relevant documents that will help you understand the=
 transaction.=20

Please observe utmost confidentiality, and be rest assured that this tran=
saction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require y=
our assistance to invest my share in your country. I can be reached throu=
gh this email address.=20

I do urgently await your response.=20

Best regards,

Mr. A.G. Furness
