  {URGENT AND CONFIDENTIAL}
(RE: TRANSFER OF ($ 126,000.000.00 USD}
{ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS)

Dear Sir,

We want to transfer to overseas ($ 126,000.000.00USD) One hundred and Twenty 
six million United States Dollars) from a Bank in Africa, I want to ask you 
to quietly  look for a reliable and honest person who
will be capable and fit to provide either an existing bank account or to set 
up a new  Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty a/c can 
serve to receive this money, as long as you will remain honest to me till 
the end for this important business trusting in you and believing  in God 
that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr.Eze Ekeyion, the Auditor General of a bank in Africa, during the 
course of our auditing  I discovered a floating fund  in an account opened 
in the bank in 1990 and since 1993 nobody has operated on this account 
again, after going through some old files in the records I discovered that 
the owner of the account  died without a [heir]  hence  the money is 
floating and  if I do not remit this money out
urgently it will be forfeited for nothing. the owner of this account is  Mr. 
Phillip Morris, a foreigner, and a sailor, and  he died,  since 1993, and  
no other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the 
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well 
that Phillip Morris until his death was the manager Morris & Morris 
Coy.(pty). SA.


We will start the  first transfer with Twenty six million [$26,000.000] upon 
successful transaction without any disappoint from your side, we shall 
re-apply for the payment of the remaining amount to your account.

The amount involved is (USD 126M) One hundred and Twenty Six million United 
States Dollars, only I want to first transfer $26,000.000 [Twenty Six 
million United States Dollar from this money into a safe
foreigners account abroad before the rest, but I don't know any foreigner, I 
am only contacting you as a foreigner because this money can not be approved 
to a local person here, without valid international
foreign passport, but can only be approved to any foreigner with valid 
international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c  because the money 
is in US Dollars and the former owner of the  a/c  Mr. Phillip Morris is a 
foreigner too, [and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

However, we will sign a binding agreement, to bind us together I got your 
contact address  from the Girl who operates computer, I am revealing this to 
you with believe in God that you will never let me down in this business, 
you are the first and the only person that I am contacting for this 
business, so please reply urgently so that I will inform you the next step 
to take urgently. Send also your private telephone and fax number including 
the full details of the account to be used for the deposit.

I want us to meet face to face to build confidence and to sign a binding 
agreement that will  bind us together  before transferring the money to any 
account of  your choice  where the fund will be safe. Before we fly to your 
country for withdrawal, sharing and investments.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine, because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive 
response and once I am convinced that you are  capable  and will meet up 
with instruction of  a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in 
this business.

I need your strong assurance that you will never, never let me down.

With my influence and the position of the bank official we can transfer this 
money to any foreigner's reliable account which you can provide with 
assurance that this money will be intact pending our physical arrival in 
your country for sharing. The bank official will destroy all documents of 
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place 
and to build confidence  you can  come immediately  to discuss with me face 
to face after which I will make this remittance in your presence and three 
of us will fly to your country at least two days ahead of the money going 
into the account.

I will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately I hear from you that 
you are ready to act and receive this fund in your account. I will use my 
position and influence to obtain all legal approvals for  onward
transfer of this money to your account with appropriate clearance from  the 
relevant  ministries and foreign exchange departments.

At the conclusion of this business, you will be given 35% of the total 
amount, 60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.

You should try to call me on my satelite phone no. 882-1646685262. if you 
are calling my No. dial the way you use to call other countries, do not put 
South African area code, because it is a satellite phone.


Sincerely,

Eze Ekeyion.
