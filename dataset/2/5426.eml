Dear Sir, 
I am Wright Gilbson in London, my Late client an expatriate was Killed 
in an unknown circumstance and before his death, deposited a 
consignment containing $7,500,000.00 U.S Dollars with a vault Company

very difficult for me before those consignments get confiscated or 
declared unserviceable by the vault company because they have given me

mandate to present any family heirs to my late client. 
This is why I am writing to you so that I will assist you claim this 
consignment. I will prepare every operation that will assist your 
claim. 
The consignment will be released to you within 12 working days after 
you have filed in for claims. I will like you to acknowledge the 
receipt 
of this e-mail as soon as possible via my email with the following 
information: 
(1) Your full name. 
(2) Home or office address. 
(3) Your Private phone and fax numbers. 
I look forward to your quick reply. 
Sincerely, 
Mr. Wright Gilbson.
