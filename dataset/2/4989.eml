<P>INTRODUCTION: My name is mike Paul. I know this proposal will come to you<BR>as a surprise because we havenot met before either physically or through any<BR>correspondence.</P>
<P>&nbsp;I have no doubt in your ability to handle this proposal<BR>involving huge sum of USD$9.5MILLION&nbsp; on my familys behalf.THE SUBJECT: A Foreign Customer (MR. JOHN WOOD) who died along with his<BR>entire family in 31st JULY , 2000 in a plane crash. since his death, as<BR>his accounts Officer I have made frantic efforts to locate any of his<BR>relative, because he has a substantial amount with our Branch. Uphill date<BR>nobody has showed up to lay claim on his deposit.The Banking law and<BR>guideline here in my Country stipulates that if any customer account remains<BR>unserviceable or dormant, and unclaimed after Four years, the account will<BR>be transferred into the Bank treasury on grounds of<BR>Money Laundering ,Drug and Anti -Terrorist activities.</P>
<P><BR>As a Banker I know what happens to such funds, the Executive Director and<BR>the Chairman of the Board of Directors will share it amongst themselves and<BR>send down memos to us for reconciliation.</P>
<P><BR>THE PROPOSAL: My request of a foreigner in this business is occasioned by<BR>the fact that an Indigene of My Country cannot stand as next of kin to a<BR>foreigner. It is therefore on this premise that I seek your cooperation By<BR>standing as a relative to MR JOHN WOOD.</P>
<P><BR>As an Insider I will provide you with all relevant Information/documents<BR>that will authenticate the Claim. Note that your Physical presence is not<BR>needed at the Bank, I will Guide you on the Steps to take. The Bank will<BR>only ask for verifiable Documents which I will provide.</P>
<P><BR>In All Fairness I am willing to share the money with you on Agreed Terms of usd4.5million for you and usd$5million for me.<BR>For your Information, I have done my home work very well, before embarking<BR>on the process of moving out the funds out of the bank through a Next of<BR>Kin. The Funds is much that no right thinking person can afford to let such<BR>opportunity pass him by.</P>
