>From the Auditor=20
Head of the Department,
First Commercial Bank
29=20
Wilson Street,
London. EC2M 2SJ.

Dear Friend,
I am Titus James Morris=20
auditor with First CommercialBank,United Kingdom. And for reasons which=20
will become obvious to you as you read on, I obtained your address=20
particulars from an internet address listing. Please exercise some=20
patience and read through my message.=20

I have a very urgent and=20
Confidential Business Proposition for you. On June 6th 1999, a Gold=20
Consultant/Contractor with the British National Gold Corporation, Mr.=20
Ahmed Yousef Mustafa, a National of Kuwait, made a numbered time=20
(Fixed) Deposit for 12 calendar months, value =C2=A312,500,000.00 (Twelve=
=20
Million Five Hundred Thousand British Pounds) in my branch.=20

On=20
maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but=20
got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally, his=20
contract employers, the British national gold corporation wrote to=20
inform us that Mr. Ahmed Yousef Mustafa died on an automobile accident;=20
that he died without making a will, and all attempts to trace his next=20
of kin through the Kuwait Embassy were fruitless.=20

At first I was=20
surprised that i did not receive much official cooperation in my=20
inquiries in order to trace his kin in Kuwait, and inform them about=20
Mr. Mustafa deposit of (GBP12.5m) plus accrued interest. I therefore=20
made further investigations and discovered that Mr. Ahmed Yousef=20
Mustafa had
actively opposed the government of his country Kuwait,and=20
was consequently driven into exile. Being a mining expert, he=20
subsequently obtained a job with the British national gold corporation,=20
and settled in London.=20

Thereafter, he walked into my office to make=20
the aforementioned deposit of (GBP 12.5m).He did not declare any kin in=20
his application paperwork, contrary to laid down procedures, and wheni=20
asked him he informed me that he wished it so. I accepted his=20
application because banks are conservative and will always honour a=20
customer'swishes, especially high networth customers.=20

My proposal=20
therefore is that I am looking for a foreigner who will stand in as the=20
next of kin to Mr.Mustafa. It is not necessary to be a blood relation=20
to Mr. Mustafa, nor have the same name. It is not also necessary to=20
come from the same country. I have workedout the modalities to achieve=20
my aim of appointing a next of kin, and therefore, also by this means=20
transfer this money total =C2=A312.5m abroad for us to share.=20

Once you=20
indicate your interest, I will initiate the processing of the transfer=20
and in about 14 working days the money total =C2=A312.5m will be in your=20
nominated bank account for us to share in the ratio of 70% for me and=20
30% for you.=20

Thanks and God bless,

Looking forward to your urgent=20
reply.

Mr.Titus James Morris.
