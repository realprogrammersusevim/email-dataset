d`ivoire in West Africa.=20
  On the March 27 2005 my father was brutally murdered by a rival clan in=
 the Dagbon region where my father was the King for so many years. This i=
s a culmination of three days of violence which left my father and his ca=
binet and the entire family death in the hands of those infidels, who not=
 only killed my father in cold blood but tortured and severed parts of hi=
s body. They also killed 28 members of the family.
  Nevertheless amidst these violence my father arranged for me and my you=
nger sister Janet escape to neighboring country Cote d`ivoire with the Do=
cuments of USD$5.2million (Five Million Two Hundred Thousand USD), He dep=
osited in a security company here in C=F4te d=92Ivoire Abidjan, in one tr=
unk Box as family valuables and treasures with my name his son as next of=
 kin, and his Foreign Business Partner as the beneficiary
  My late father instructs me that I should seek for a foreign partner in=
 a country of my choice that will assist us to claim this consignment fun=
d from the security company and use it for investment purpose such as exp=
ansion of his existing cocoa business and real estate management.
And to arrange for me and my sister to come over to your country to conti=
nue our education and also to have a new lease of life where we will be s=
afe from this unscrupulous elements.
  Please I implore you in the name of God to assist me and my sister in t=
his regards as our life is no longer safe here.
  Please indicate your position through this email so that I will furnish=
 you with the details.
  Immediately you indicate your interest in assisting me, I will forward =
all necessary documents for your perusal and also the contact of the Secu=
rity Company here in Abidjan. I have decided to compensate you with fifte=
en percent (15%) of the entire funds for your assistance.
