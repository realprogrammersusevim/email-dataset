BARRISTER DAVID.A NELSON
Equity Chambers
Lagos, Nigeria.

Attention:

Greetings to you.

I am Mr.  David.A Nelson, Principal Partner Benson & Associates (EQUITYCHAMBERS).
I need your urgent and very confidential approach to this proposition.

On April 12 2000, my client a ForeignOilConsultant/Contractor with the Nigerian
National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC), Mr. James Nartaev made a numbered
time (Fixed) Deposit for twelve calendar months, valued at US$12,000,000.00
(Twelve Million United States Dollars).

Upon maturity of his deposit, the chambers got a routine notification from
the Finance House which was sent to his forwarding address. After a month,
we got a reminder from the Finance House and I had to verify his whereabout
from his contract employers, the NNPC.

Unfortunately, I was informed by the NNPC that my client died from an automobile
accident about a month to the first letter froim the Finance House. As his
legal representative, I know that my client died without making a WILL,and
all my attempts to trace his next of kin has been fruitless.

Furthermore, as his attorney, I am aware that he did not declare any next
of kin or relations in all his official documents, including his Depository
Form with the Finance House.According to Nigerian Law, at the expiration
of 3 (three) years, the money will revert to the ownership of the Nigerian
Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

Since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives, I seek your
consent to present you as the next of kin of my late client so that the
proceeds of this account valued at 12 million dollars (minus incurred interest)can
be paid to you. I will expect you to use your human discretion in sharing
the funds when it's been transferred into your custody.

I will put together all necessary legal documents that can be used to back
up any claim we may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable
us see this deal through particularly your words of honor not to sit on
the funds when it's in your control.

 Please! I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with
me by my email and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to enable us
discuss furtherabout this transaction.

I wait to hear from you soon. Have a nice day.Thank you.

Barrister  David  Nelson
