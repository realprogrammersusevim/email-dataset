FROM:MR. MR. HASSAN IBRAHIM.
BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT,
BANK OF AFRICA(B.O.A),
DAKAR, SENEGAL.

Dear friend,

I know that this letter may come to you as a suprise. I got your contact 
address from the Internet when I was searching for a business partner.

My name is MR. HASSAN IBRAHIM. I am the Bill and Exchange Manager of bank of 
africa
(B.O.A) ,Dakar Senegal.

In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of USD$22.3 Million (TWEN 
TWO MILLION THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND U.S DOLLARS). In an account that belongs 
to one of our foreign customer who died along with his wife  and children in 
a plane crash in  year 2001 plane crash happened in Cote d'Ivoire.(Kenya Air 
Ways)

Since we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his 
next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it 
unless somebody applies for it as the next of kin or relation to the 
deceased, as indicated in our banking guidelines but unfortunately we learnt 
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him in the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I  decided to make this business 
proposals to you and release the money to you as next of kin or relation to 
the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming 
for it because I don't want the money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed Bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remains 
unclaimed after  five years, the money will be transferred into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner in this transaction is necessary because our late 
customer was a foreigner and a Senegalaise cannot stand as next of kin to a 
foreigner. I have agreed that 30% of this money will be for you as foreign 
partner in respect to the provision of a foreign account. 10% will be set 
aside for expenses incurred during the business and 60% would be for me, 
after which I shall visit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you as i 
arranged,you will furnished me with a good receving account detail where the 
money will be transfered, your private tel and fax number for easy 
communication.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or e-mail a text of 
the application which you shall retype and fax to our foreign remittance 
director,for easy execution of the transaction.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is 100% 
hitch-free on both side. As all required arrangement have been made for the 
transfer.

Please I would like you  keep this transaction confidential and as a top 
secret as you may wish to know that I am a Bank official.

Trusting to hear from you immediately.

Yours Sincerely,
MR. HASSAN IBRAHIM.
