Dear Sir/Madam 
 
ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATE 
 
I write to inform you of my desire to acquire estates 
or landed properties in your country on behalf of the 
Director of Contracts and Finance Allocations of the 
Federal Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria. 
 
Considering his very strategic and influential 
position, he would want the transaction to be as 
strictly confidential as possible. He further wants 
his identity to remain undisclosed at least for now, 
untill the completion of the transaction. Hence our 
desire to have an overseas agent. 
 
I have therefore been directed to inquire if you would 
agree to act as our overseas agent in order to 
actualize this transaction. 
 
The deal, in brief, is that the funds with which we 
intend to carry out our proposed investments in your 
country is presently in a coded account at the 
Nigerian Apex Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria) 
and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to 
your country in a convenient bank account that will be 
provided by you before we can put the funds 
into use in your country. For this, you shall be 
considered to have executed a contract for the Federal 
Ministry of Works and Housing in Nigeria for which 
payment should be effected to you by the Ministry, The 
contract sum of which shall run into US$27.4 Million, 
of which your share shall be 25% and 5% for expenses if you agree to be 
our overseas agent. 
 
As soon as payment is effected, and the amount 
mentioned above is successfully transferred into your 
account, we intend to use our own share in acquiring 
some estates abroad. For this too you shall also serve as our agent. 
 
In the light of this, I would like you to forward to 
me the following information: 
 
1. Your company name and address if any 
2. Your personal fax number 
3. Your personal telephone number for easy 
communication. 
 
You are requested to communicate your acceptance of 
this proposal through my above stated email address 
after which we shall discuss in details the modalities 
 
for seeing this transaction through. 
 
Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank 
you in anticipation of your cooperation. 
 
Yours faithfully, 
 
DR. JAMES ALBERT
