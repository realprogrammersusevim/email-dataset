FROM =3A MRS ASHIA HASSAN 

 PRAISE ALLAH=2C THE MOST BENEVOLENT

I am the above named person from Kuwait=2E I am married to Late 
herina bana of blessed memory who worked with Kuwait embassy in 
Sudan for nine years before he died in the year 2002=2E We were 
married for eleven years without a child=2EHe died after a brief 
illness that lasted for only four days=2E Before his death we were 
both very devoted muslims=2E 
 
Since his death I too have been battling with both cancer and 
fibroid problems=2EWhen my late husband was alive he deposited 
the sum of $20 Million =28Twenty  Million U=2ES=2E Dollars=29 with an 
oversea private security and holding firm =2E 
 
Presently=2C this money is still with the private security and 
holding firm in Malaysia =2CAsia=2E Recently=2C my Doctor told me that 
I would not last for the next three months due to cancer problem=2E 
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness=2E Having known my

 condition I decided to donate this fund to either a moslem organisation or 
devoted muslim individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to
 instruct here- in=2E I want this muslim organisation or individual to use this
 money in all sincererity to fund mosques=2C orphanages=2Cwidows and also propagating
the word of ALLAH and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of

the holy Quran=2E 
 
The holy Quran emphasized so much on ALLAH'S benevolence and this has encouraged 
me to take this bold step=2E I took this decision because I don=A1=A6t have any child 


that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are new Christians
 converts and I don=A1=A6t want my husband=A1=A6s hard earned money to be misused
 by people I call unbelievers=2E 
 
I don=A1=A6t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner=2E 
Hence the reason for taking this bold decision=2E I know that after death 
I will be with ALLAH the most beneficient and the most merciful=2E I don=A1=A6t 
need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and 
the presence of my 
husband=A1=A6s relatives around me always=2E I don=A1=A6t want them to know about 
this development=2E 
 
With ALLAH all things are possible=2E As soon as I receive your reply 
I shall give you the contact of the Security Company=2E I will also 
issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- 

beneficiary of this fund=2E I want you and the Muslim community where 
you reside to always pray for me=2E My happiness is that I lived a life 
of a true devoted muslim worthy of emulation=2E Whoever that wants to 
serve the ALLAH must serve him in truth and in fairness=2E 
 
Please always be prayerful all through your life=2E Any delay in your 
reply will give me room in sourcing For a muslim organisation or a 
devoted muslim for this same purpose=2E Until I hear from you=2C my dreams
 will rest squarely on your shoulders=2E May the almighty ALLAH continue 
to guide and protect you=2E
