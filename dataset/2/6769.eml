This letter must come to you as a big surprise, but I believe it is only a =
day that people meet and become great friends and business partners.  I am =
Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN, currently Head of Corporate affairs with a reputable =
bank here in Dubai -U. A. E. I write you this proposal in good faith, =
believing that I can trust you with the information I am about to reveal to =
you.
I have an urgent and very confidential business proposition for you. On =
November 6, 2000, an Iraqi Foreign Oil consultant/contractor with the CHEVRON =
PETROLEUM CORPORATION, MR. KHALIL AL NASSER made a (Fixed deposit) for 36 =
calendar months, valued at US$17,500,000.00 (Seventeen Million Five hundred =
Thousand Dollars only) in my bank and I happen to be his account officer =
before I was moved to my present position recently. Upon maturity in 2003, as =
his account officer and as well the bank manger, it is my duty to notify him =
on the maturity date so I sent a routine notification to his forwarding =
address but the letter was returned undelivered. 
After sometime, I tried sending back the letter, but it was again returned =
and finally I discovered from his contract employers, Chevron Petroleum =
Corporation that Mr. Khalil Al Nasser died as a result of torture in the hand =
of Saddam Hussein (former Iraqi President) during one of his trips to his =
country Iraq, as he was accused of leaking information to the Americans. On =
further investigation, I discovered that Mr. Al Nasser? family wife and two =
sons died during the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not =
declare any next of kin or relation in all his official documents, including =
his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not leave any WILL. 
This sum of US$17,500,000.00 have been floating and placed under dormant/ =
unserviceable account by my bank management since no one have heard from the =
owner since 2003. I wish to let you know that all the investigation I have =
made so far, my bank management is not aware of it, I am the only one that =
have the information.
 With the recent change of government in my country and with their efforts to =
support the United Nations in checkmating terrorism aid in the U. A. E. By =
end of this year, the government will pass a new financial control law which =
will give the government authority to interrogate account owners of above =
$5,000,000.00 to explain the source of the funds, making sure it is not for =
terrorism support. If I do not move this money out of the country =
immediately, by end of the year the government will definitely confiscate the =
money, because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain the source =
of the money. 
 I cannot directly transfer out this money without the help of a foreigner =
and that is why I am contacting you for an assistance. As the Account Officer =
to late Al Nasser, coupled with my present position and status in the bank as =
Head of Retail Banking Group, I have the power to influence the release of =
the funds to any foreigner that comes up as the next of kin to the account, =
with the correct information concerning the account, which I shall give you. =
All documents to enable you claim this fund will be carefully worked out and =
there is practically no risk involved, the transaction will be executed under =
a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of law, beside =
U. A. E is porous and anything goes.
 If you accept to work with me, I want you to state how you wish us to share =
the funds in percentage, so that both parties will be satisfied. If you are =
interested, contact me as soon as you receive this message so we can go over =
the details. Thanking you in advance and may God bless you. Please, treat =
with utmost confidentiality. 
 I shall send you copy of the deposit certificate issued to Al Nasser when =
the deposit was made for your perusal. I wait your urgent reply through my =
private email address: ateeq_khan001@yahoo.com
Regards, 
Mr. Ateeq Rahman KHAN
