My dear, 

Good day and God bless you. It is with deep sence of commitment, faith an=
d
trust that I make this confidential risk free business proposal to you fo=
r
your assistance/partnership. I am deeply sorry if I have in any manner di=
sturbe
your privacy. 

I am Mr. Alfred Douglas the head of the Audit Department of Continental
Bank in Cotounu Benin Republic. Recently, I discovered a domant account
with a huge amount of money valued at USD15.500,000.00 (fifteen million
,five hundred thousand US dollars) that belongs to one of our numerouse
customers MR.PIERE JOHNSON from Germany who died in a ghastly motor accid=
ent
in Cotounu on 5th OF May 2000. During the period of my investigation I di=
scovered
that the deceased left no will and nobody behind to come for the claim as=

his beneficiary. Since then several inquiries to locate any of MR. PIERE
JOHNSON extended relatives have proved unsuccessful, hence I decided to
contact you since the banking law here stipulates that if such money rema=
in
unclaimed for a period of time, it will be forfieted to the gorvernment
treasury as an unclaimed fund which will be expended on acquiring dangeri=
ouse
weaponse for the support of their selfish political interest and promotin=
g
wars and ethnic crises in Africa. I  have decided to contact you to assis=
t
me to pull out this fund from this bank as the business partner of MR. PI=
ERE
JOHNSON for the claim of the fund. I want to also bring to your notice th=
at
as the Head of the Audit department of this bank if this fund is not pull=
ed
out before our auditing the fund fund will be discovered by my colleagues=

and that will definately lead to the government confiscating the money in=
to
the federation account. 

You might ask what will be the proceedure to achieve this. As soon as I
get your positive response to assist me, I will then send to you the proc=
eedure
and the next step to follow. So if this meets your interest then get back=

to me to enable me send to you the procedure of claiming this fund. I hav=
e
in my possetion all the necessary information of the deceased (MR. PIERE
JOHNSON) that will help us successfully accomplish this transaction. You
shall be offered 30% for your assistance, while 5% shall be set aside for=

any expences that we might incure during the transaction.

Futher response shall be giving to you as soon as I recieve your positive=

response. Fell free to call me on my private number (229) 28 30 63 for an=
y
question you may wish to ask me.

Anticipating your urgent reply. 

Regards, 
Mr. Alfred Douglas
