DEAR BELOVED, <BR>
<BR>
I am Sussan Adams <BR>
<BR>
PLEASE ENDEAVOUR TO USE IT FOR THE CHILDREN OF GOD. I am the above named =
person. I am married to Dr. Donald Adams A LIBERIAN but I=92m now in Nige=
rian General HOSPITAL taking treatment for my sickness, who worked with U=
.S embassy in LIBERIAN for nine years before he died in the year 2000. We=
 were married for eleven years without a child. He died after a brief ill=
ness that lasted for only four days. Before his death we were both born a=
gain Christians. Since his death I decided not to re-marry or get a child=
 outside my matrimonial home which the Bible is against. <BR>
<BR>
When my late husband was alive he deposited the sum of$10.5 Million (Ten =
Million five hundred thousand U.S.Dollars) with A Bank Presently, this mo=
ney is still under the safe keeping of the Reserve FINANCE COMPANY Recent=
ly, my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next SEVEN months due=
 to my cancer <BR>
problems. <BR>
<BR>
Though what disturbs me most is my stroke.Having known my condition, I de=
cided to donate this fund to church or better still a Christian or muslim=
 individual That will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct h=
ere in. I want a church that will use this fund on, orphanages, deaf and =
domb and poor widows propagating the word of God and to ensure that the h=
ouse of God is maintained. The Bible made us to understand that blessed i=
s the hand that giveth. I took this decision because I don't have any chi=
ld that will inherit this money and my husband relatives are not Christia=
ns and I don't want my husband's hard earned money to be misused by unbel=
ievers. I don't want a situation where this money will be used in an ungo=
dly manner. Hence the reason for taking this bold decision. <BR>
<BR>
I am not afraid of death hence I know where I am going. I know that I am =
going to be in the bosom of the Lord. Exodus 14 VS 14 says that the lord =
will fight my case and I shall hold my peace. I don't need any telephone =
communication in this regard because of my health because of the presence=
 of my husband's relatives around me always. I don't want them to know ab=
out this development. With God all things are possible. As soon as I rece=
ive your reply I forward your personal information, such as Your full nam=
e, Your full address, with Your telephone and fax number to my lawyer so =
that he will contact you as the legal owner of my fund before the bank wi=
ll be transferring the fund into your nominated Bank Account in your coun=
try. <BR>
<BR>
I will also issue you a letter of a authority that will back you up as th=
e real next of kin and the original- beneficiary of my fund. I want you a=
nd the church to always pray for me because the lord is my shepherd,you w=
ill also promise me that you will not seat on the fund when it gets into =
your bank account. My happiness is that I lived a life of a worthy Christ=
ian. Whoever that wants to serve the Lord must serve him in spirit and tr=
uth. Please always be prayerful all through your life, any delay in your =
reply will give me room in serching for a church or Christian individual =
for this same purpose. Please assure me that you will act accordingly as =
I stated herein. Hoping to hear from you as soon as possible. <BR>
<BR>
Remain blessed in the name of the Lord. <BR>
<BR>
Yours in Christ, <BR>
<BR>
Mrs. Sussan Adams <BR>
