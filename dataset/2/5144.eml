ONT><BR>Compliment Of The Season, <BR><BR>On a very good day. I am (Trevo=
r Gumel&nbsp; Esq),the Head of file Department in African developent bank=
 (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist=20
 search.<BR><BR>When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of y=
our capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when=
 i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an aba=
ndoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars)=
 . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died alo=
ng with his entire family in <FONT color=3D#bf00bf><U>(Monday 31st July 2=
000)</U></FONT> in a plane crash. Since we got information about his deat=
h, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his mone=
y because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next of =
kin or relati on to the deceased as indica ted in our banking guidelines,=
 but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relatio=
n died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for th=
e claim. It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in m=
y department now decided to make this busin
 ness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or =
relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nob=
ody is coming for it and we don=92t want this money to go into the bank t=
reasury as unclaimed bill.<BR><BR>The Banking law and guideline here stip=
ulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money w=
ill be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request o=
f foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact tha=
t the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of k=
in to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as fo=
reign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % wil=
l be set aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be=
 for me and my woman colleague. There after i will visit your country for=
 disbursement according to the percentages indicated. <BR><BR>Therefore t=
o enable the immediate trnansfer of this fu
 nd to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or =
next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account =
number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective comm=
unication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of y=
our reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application=
 I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch f=
ree and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required ar=
rangements have been made for thetransfer. <BR><BR>You should contact me =
