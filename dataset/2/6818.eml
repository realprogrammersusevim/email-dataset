My Dear Friend=2C

My name is Mr=2EMusa A=2E Zulu=2C the manager=2C credit
and foreign bills in African Development Bank Plc=2E
I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of
my bank with account number 89-3k7-1996=2Fadb who
perished in a plane crash =5BKorean Air Flight 801=5D
with the whole passengers aboard on August 6=2C 1997=2E

Since the demise of this our customer=2C whom I could not care lessa
bout=2C
I personally
have watched with keen interest to see the next of kin
but all has proved abortive as no one has come to
claim his funds of us$=2E57 m=2C =5BFifty seven million
united states dollars=5D which has been with my branch
for a very long time=2E

On this note=2C I decided to seek for whom his name
could be used as the next of kin as no one has come up
to be the next of kin=2E And the banking ethics here
does not allow such money to stay more than seven
years=2C because the money will be recalled to the bank
treasury as unclaimed after this period=2E In view of
this I got your contact through my search via business
report from your web site to see if you can assist=2E I
will give you 25% of the total=2E

Upon the receipt of your response=2C I will send to you
by fax or e-mail the application letter=2C bank's fax
number and the next step to take=2E I will not fail to
bring to your notice that this business is hitch free
and that you should not entertain any fear as all
modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within
five banking days=2C after you apply to the bank as a
relation to the deceased=2E
When you receive this letter=2E Kindly send me an e-mail
signifying Your decision including your private
Tel=2FFax numbers for quick communication=2E

Yours faithfully=2C

Musa A Zulu=2E
