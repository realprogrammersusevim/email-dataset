(STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL)
FROM THE DESK OF ( MR. YSOUF AROUNA)
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT /FOREIGN REMITTANCE DEPT.
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (A.D.B)OUAGADOUGOU -BF
REQUEST FOR THE URGENT TRANSFER OF THE SUM (US$10.5million) ONLY
INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

You may be surprise to receive this message from me since you don't
know me in person, but for the purpose of introduction., I got your
impressive information through an international business equiry .

But I respectfully insist you read crefully as I am optimistic it
will open doors for unimaginable financial reward for both us.
This business transaction might not fall within the wide spectrum of
your business activities ,but I plead your assistance ,as your flair
for profitable business is needed .

Permit me to introduce myself. I am MR. YSOUF AROUNA. the Manager of
auditing and accounting unit at the foreign remittance department of
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK . In My department I discovered an
abandoned sum of$ 10.5m US dollars . In an account that belongs to
one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire family in
november 2002 in a plane crash.

Since I got information about his death, I have been expecting his
next of kin to come over and claim his money because wecannot
release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation
to the deceased anindicated in our banking guidelines but
unfortunately I learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation
died alongside
with him at the planecrash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I and other officials in my
department now decided to make businness proposal to you and release
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for
safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and
I don?t want this money to go into the Bank treasury as unclaimed
Bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money
remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered
into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund.

The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is
occasioned bythe fact that the customer was a foreigner and a
Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.
I agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner,
inrespect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 %will be set
aside for expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for
me . There after I will visit your country with my family for
disbursement according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of
kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account
number,
your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective
communication and location where in the money will be remitted .

On your acceptance, I will send to the text of application by fax or
by email which you are going to apply to the bank ; and provide
materials confirmation references and inquiries regarding payment
formalities from the payment Agency. I willbe handling official
protocols here and expect you to undertake international
responsibilities as I am assuring you of a risk free transaction
provided you display maturity.

Therefore, if you are willing and interested to render
the needed assistance, endeavor to reply through my
email address .

Thanking you in anticipation of your kind considerations.

Yours sincerely.

MR. YSOUF AROUNA.
