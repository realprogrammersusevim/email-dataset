Lagos, Nigeria.



Dear Friend,

I am Dr.Peter Akinjide,on behalf of my colleagues from different Federal
Government of Nigeria owned parastatals decided to solicit your assistanc=
e
as regards transfer of US$41,500,000.00 (Fourty one Million,five Hundred
Thousand US Dollars)into your bank account. These funds emanated from unc=
laimed
contractual proceeds of foreign contracting firms who could not meet thei=
r
financial obligations to their creditors. We, as holders of sensitive pos=
itions
in our various parastatals, were mandated by the Federal Government to sc=
rutinise
all payments made to certain foreign contractors and we discovered that
some of the contractors have not been paid their contractual entitlement
which collectively left the sum of US$46,500,000.00 (Fourty six Million,f=
ive
Hundred Thousand US Dollars) lying in a suspended Account.

However,from our investigations,we discovered that the foreign beneficiar=
y
companies have since been liquidated, and to all intents and purposes no
longer exist in Nigeria, thus providing us with this 
opportunity,provided that we have a capable partner, to execute a transac=
tion
of this nature.

We agreed that the said amount would be transferred into an overseas Bank=

Account to be provided by a reliable foreign firm/associate. This is beca=
use
as serving Government workers the Civil Service Code does not allow us to=

operate foreign Account. In our initial attempt to do 
this,we succeeded in transferring part of this amount US$5m (Five Million=

Dollars)into a United States Dollar Account in Beirut, Lebanon, but our
foreign associate failed to honour our mutual agreement insisting instead=

that the total amount be transferred into the Account before we can share=

the money.

As a result, we have lost confidence in the ability of our Lebanese partn=
er
to see this matter to its logical conclusion,and until the initial transa=
ction
is satisfactorily resolved,we have cancelled further transactions with hi=
m.In
the light of the foregoing,it is clear 
that we require a partner that is not only capable of rendering assistanc=
e
and cooperation in executing this matter, but will honour the terms of ag=
reement
when we reach the concluding stages of this transaction.

We therefore offer the amount of 20% of the entire sum in return for serv=
ices/assistance
rendered in successfully carrying out this project.We trust that you appr=
eciate
the sensitive nature of this matter and the need for initial caution on
our part, but when a relationship is confidently established and operatio=
ns
commence you will be provided with all relevant information.

I remain at your disposal to entertain any questions/enquiries relating
to this proposition and you may contact me as a matter of urgency via e-m=
ail
for further information on the procedures and requirements of this transa=
ction.In
your reply, remember to indicate a safe telephone number where I can alwa=
ys
reach you. Hope to hear from you soon. Please treat with the strictest co=
nfidentiality
and expediency.

Yours faithfully,

Dr.Peter Akinjide
