From
			  the Editor












			  Every time I jumped to bed with a girl, I thought,
			  "Please, don't fall down, lovestick!"


What a stress. And, to make it clear, sometimes my words didn't
			  help.

			  Then I visited this e-store,
			  tried blue pilules and understood, why there are so many stories
			  around it. I just recommend you to try. Fistful of dollars will
			  bring you desire!
