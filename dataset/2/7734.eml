tment in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tour=
ist search.<BR><BR>When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured o=
f your capability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity w=
hen i prayed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an =
abandoned sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dolla=
rs) . In an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died =
along with his entire family in <FONT color=3D#bf00bf><U>(Monday 31st Jul=
y 2000)</U></FONT> in a plane crash. Since we got information about his d=
eath, we have been expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his m=
oney because we cannot release it unless somebody applies for it as next =
of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines=
, but unfortunately we learnt that all his=20
 supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane cr=
ash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is therefore upon this discov=
ery that I and one official in my department now decided to make this bus=
inness proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or=
 relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since no=
body is coming for it and we don=92t want this money to go into the bank =
treasury as unclaimed bill.<BR><BR>The Banking law and guideline here sti=
pulates that if such money remained unclamed after five years, the money =
will be transfered into the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request =
of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact th=
at the customer was a foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of =
kin to a foreigner. We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as f=
oreign partner, in respect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % wi=
ll be set aside for expenses incured during
  the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman colleague. There aft=
er i will visit your country for disbursement according to the percentage=
s indicated. <BR><BR>Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this =
fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or=
 next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account=
 number, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective com=
munication and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of =
your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the applicatio=
n I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch =
free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required a=
rrangements have been made for thetransfer. <BR><BR>You should contact me=
 on my number <FONT color=3D#ff409f>00226-7885 75 97</FONT>, immediately =
