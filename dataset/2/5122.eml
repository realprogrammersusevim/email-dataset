his country Iraq=2C as he was accused of leaking information 
to the Americans=2E On further investigation=2C I discovered 
that Mr=2E Al Nasser's family wife and two sons died during 
the Gulf War in Iraq and was the reason why he did not declare 
any next of kin or relation in all his official documents=2C 
including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank and did not

making sure it is not for terrorism support=2E  If I do not 
move this money out of the country immediately=2C by end of 
the year the government will definitely confiscate the money=2C 
because my bank cannot provide the account owner to explain 
the source of the money=2E

assistance=2E  As the Account Officer to late Al Nasser=2Ccoupled
