<FONT color=3D#000080><B>My Name is John Amane Clarke, managing director =
of Diamond Security & Storage Company here in Accra- Ghana. In my departm=
ent, I discovered an abandoned consignment worth over sum of US$12Million=
 dollars (Twelve Million US dollars) in file that belongs to our foreign =
customer, </B></FONT><BR>

<FONT color=3D#000080><B>LATE MR. ANDREAS SCHRANNER from Munich, Germany =
who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash. Belo=

<FONT color=3D#000080><B>Since then, I have made several enquiries to loc=

</FONT><BR>
<FONT color=3D#000080><B> </B></FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT color=3D#000080><B>The reason why I am contacting you is based on t=
rust to enable me present you as the next-of-kin to him so this consignme=
nt will be released to you for safety and subsequent disbursement. </B></=

<FONT color=3D#000080><B> </B></FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT color=3D#000080><B>Nobody has come to our company for claiming of t=
he consignment. </B></FONT><BR>
<FONT color=3D#000080><B> </B></FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT color=3D#000080><B>It will be easy to convince the company since I =
am in possession of the necessary legalised documents that backs-up the c=
onsignment and which will present you as the rightful next-of-kin to the =
deceased customer. I don't want this consignment to go into company,s tre=
asury as unclaimed bill. </B></FONT><BR>
<FONT color=3D#000080><B> </B></FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT color=3D#000080><B>The company laws and guidelines stipulates that =
if such consignment remains unclaimed after seven years, the company will=
 confiscate it. </B></FONT><BR>
<FONT color=3D#000080><B> </B></FONT></DIV>
<DIV>
<FONT color=3D#000080><B>The request for a foreigner as next-of-kin in th=
is transaction is occasioned by the fact that late ANDREAS was a foreigne=
r and any indigene cannot stand as next-of-kin to a foreigner.</B></FONT>=

ble us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be execut=
ed under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach o=
f the law. I agree that 25% of this money will be for you as a respect to=

sement according to the percentage indicated. Therefore, to enable the im=
