Dear One,

 My name is Master Karonga Zungu, the son of Mr.Ellies Karonga of blessed memory from Zimbabwe, During the current crises against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of President Robert Mugabe 
to claim all  citizens both black/white farmers  farms,  who where not  his party members and his followers, he ordered all white/black farmers who were not in his party to surrender all their farms to his 
party members and his followers.

 My father  was one of the most successful multy farmers in our country and because he did not support Mugabe`s ideas, Mugabes supporters invaded his farm and burnt everything in the farm, killing him and made away with a lot of farming items in my fathers farm.

 Before his death, my father had deposited with banking firm in (Europe)  the sum of (USD $12 MILLION) for buying of new farming materials.But I can't transfer it, to where i live becouse  I'm an Asylum seeker,and not allowed to operate bank accounts, i want to go into arrangement by which i can live in your country and get my money back for benefitable investments. 

 I have agreed to offer you 10% of the total sum for your assistance as soon as the money gets into your account also 5% has been set aside for all expences onece the money is cleard,any expences  incured 
by you in the act of claiming this funds and making the transfer to your account will be deducted from the 5%  before  any other  step is taken.
