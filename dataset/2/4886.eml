ATTENTION=3A

Sir=2F

I am Dr=2E =28Mrs=29 Mariam Abacha wife to the late Nigerian
Head of State=2C General Sani Abacha who died on the 8th
of June 1998 while on active duty=2E I am contacting you
in view of the fact we will be of great assistance to
each other=2C likewise developing a cordial business
relationship=2E

I currently have within my reach the sum of Fifty-five
Million United States Dollars =28$55=2C000=2C000=2C00=29 cash=2C
which I intend to use for investment purposes
specifically in your country=2E This money came as a
result of a pay-back contract deal between my late
husband and a Russian firm in our country=92s
Multi-billion dollar Ajaokuta Steel plant=2E The Russian
partners returned my Husband=92s share of
US$55=2C000=2C000=2E00 U=2ES=2ED after his death=2C and lodged it
in my late husband=92s Security company of which I am a
Director Right now=2C the new Civilian Government has
intensified their probe on my late Husband=92s Financial
resources and have frozen our accounts=2E In view of
these facts=2C I acted fast to withdraw the
US$55=2C000=2C000=2E00 U=2ES=2ED from the company=92s vault and
deposited it in a privately owned security safe in my
village=2E I have since declared the security company
bankrupt=2E No record whatsoever exists concerning the
money traceable by the Government because=2C there is no
documentation showing that we received the money from
the Russians=2E

Due to the current situation in the country concerning
the Government=92s attitude towards my husband=2C it has
become quite impossible for me to make use of this
money within=3B thus upon consent=2C I shall expect you to
contact me urgently to enable us discuss in detail
about this transaction=2E

Bearing in mind that your assistance is needed to
transfer this fund=2C I propose a commission of 10% =28ten
percent=29 of the total sum to you for the expected
services and assistance=2E Your urgent response is
highly needed so as to stop further contact=2E I must use this
opportunity to implore you to exercise the utmost
indulgence to keep this matter extraordinarily
confidential=2C whatever your decision=2C while I await
your prompt response=2E
Send your phone nos for easier communication=2E

Best regards


DR=2E =28MRS=29 MARIAM  ABACHA
