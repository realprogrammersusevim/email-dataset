Dear Friend


You may be surprised to receive this letter from me since you do not know me =
personally. I am the first daughter of the most popular black farmer in =
Zimbabwe who was murdered in the land dispute in my country.

 I got your contact through network online hence i decided to write you. =
Before the death of my father, he took me to Johannesburg to deposit the sum =
of US$30 Million (thirty million United States dollars), in one of the  =
security company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. This money =
was deposited in a box as gem stones to avoid much demurrage from the =
Security Company.

This amount was meant for the purchase of new machines and chemicals for the =
Farms and establishment of new farms in Swaziland. This land problem came =
when Zimbabwean President Mr. Robert Mugabe,  introduced a new Land Act =
Reform wholly affecting the rich white farmers and some few black farmers, =
and this resulted to the killing and mob action by Zimbabwean war veterans =
and some lunatics in the society. In fact a lot of people were killed because =
of this Land reform Act for which my father was one of the victims. it is =
against this background that I and my family fled

Zimbabwe to South Africa for fear of our lives.

After which, I traveled to the Netherlands and I am currently staying in the =
Netherlands where i am seeking political asylum and more so have decided to =
transfer my father's money to a more reliable foreign account. Since the law =
of Europe prohibits a refugee (asylum seeker) to open any bank account or to =
be involved in any financial transaction throughout the territorial zone of =
European Union. As the eldest child of my father, I am saddled with the =
responsibility of seeking a genuine foreign account where this money could be =
transferred without the knowledge of my government who are bent on taking =
everything we have got.

The South African government seems to be playing along with them. I am faced =
with the dilemma of moving this amount of money out of my family name for =
fear of going through difficulty in future. Both countries have similar =
political history. I am seeking for a partner who I have to entrust my future =
and that of my family in his hands, I must let you know that this transaction =
is risk free. If you accept to assist me and my family, all I want you to do =
for me, is to make arrangements with the security company to clear the =
Consignment (funds) from their affiliate office here in the Netherlands as i =
have already given directives for the consignment to be brought to the =
Netherlands from South Africa.

But before then all modalities will have to be put in place like change of =
ownership to the consignment. I have two options for you. Firstly you can =
choose to have certain percentage of the money for nominating your account =
for this transaction. Or you can go into partnership with me for the proper =
profitable investment of the money in your country. Whichever the option you =
want, feel free to notify me. I have also mapped out 5% of this money for all =
kinds of expenses incurred in the process of this transaction.

If you do not prefer a partnership I am willing to give you 20% of the money =
while the remaining 75% will be for my investment in any of the country of =
your choice.  while I implore you to maintain the absolute secrecy required =
in this transaction.
I await your immediate reply and God bless.

Best regards,
Hellen Shaka Zuma

NOTE:
ON YOUR INABILITY TO HANDLE THIS TRANSACTION RESPOND TO ME AND INFORM ME SO I =
CAN LOOK FOR SOMEONE ELSE.
