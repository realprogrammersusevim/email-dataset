DR.EVERES HENRY
AUDDITOR GENERAL 
PERSONAL & CONFIDENTIAL 
ATTN: 
Dear........., 
PROVISION OF BANK ACCOUNT TO DEPOSIT FUNDS" 

Please accept my sincere apology if my email does not
meet your business or personal ethics. I will first
introduce myself as DR.EVERES HENRY, a staff in the
audit section of a well-known bank, here in London,
England.
 
One of our accounts, with holding balance of
26,000,000 (Twenty Six Million Pounds Sterling) has
been dormant and last operated three years ago. From
my investigations and confirmation, the owner of the
said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died
on the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in
Birmingham; you can view this CNN website:
(http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/)for
details on the crash. Since then, nobody has done
anything as regards the claiming of this money, as he
has no family member that has any knowledge as to the
existence of either the account or the funds; and also
information from the National Immigration also states
that he was single on entry into the UK. 

After detailed investigations on the deceased and his
account, I found out there is no mention of any heirs
or family member on the account document in the Bank
records, therefore the money was lodged secretly into
the account. Plans are to transfer the fund out with
your sincerely help.
This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles
as the fund is legitimate and does not originate from
drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal
act. 
On your interest, let me hear from you URGENTLY.
I look forward to hear from you soonest. 
May God bless you.

Warm Regards,
DR.EVERES HENRY.
