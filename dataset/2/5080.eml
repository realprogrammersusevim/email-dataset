FROM: HENRICH AGAH(ESQ)
HENRICH AGAH& ASSOCIATES,
45 RUMUBIAKANI,PORTHARCOURT
RIVERS STATE
NIGERIA. 

Dearest friend,
I am Barrister Henrich Agah, a Solicitor. I am the
Personal Attorney and Legal Representative to "Mr.
Gary Val", a national of your country, who used to
work with Shell Oil Development Company in Nigeria.
On the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife and
their three children were involved in a car accident
along Abuja Express Road. Unfortunately, they all lost
their lives in the event of the accident. Since then,
I have made several enquiries to your Embassy to
locate any of my client's extended relatives, this has
also proved unsuccessful.

After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided
to trace a reliable person  over the Internet to
locate any member of his family but of no avail,
hence, I contacted you to assist in repatriating the
money left behind by my client in a Security Company
here in Nigeria.Particularly, the Security Company
where the deceased deposited the two trunk boxes
containing $10 Million(TEN Million United States
Dollars Only) does not know the content of the two
trunk boxes deposited with them. 

Consequently, the Security Company issued me a notice
to provide the Next-of-Kin to claim the two trunk
boxes in their custody within the next ten official
working days.

Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the
relatives for over 2 years now, I seek your consent to
present you as the next-of-kin of the deceased to
claim the two trunk boxes since you are from the same
country so that the two trunk boxes can be  delivered
to you by the security company.

Upon receipt of the two trunk boxes, I will come over
to your country to meet with you for the disbursement
of the fund, and then you and me can share the money.
60% to me and 40% to you. I have all necessary legal
documents that can back up any claim we may make with
the Security Company. 

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us
see this deal through. I guarantee that this will be
executed under a legitimate arrangement that will
protect you from any breach of the law.
Please get in touch with me by my secured and
confidential e-mail address at hc_agah555@fsmail.net 


Best regards
Barrister Henrich Agah (Esq)
