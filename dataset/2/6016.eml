 I am 45 years old married with four children. I am a devoted Christian and a man of peace.   I have packaged a financial transaction that will benefit you and me, as the regional manager of the Barclays bank it is my duty to send in a financial report to my head office in the capital city Accra at the end of each business yea

r. On the course of 2005 business report, I discovered that my branch in which I am the manager made two million five hundred and fifty thousand united state dollars ($2,550,000.00) which



 my head office are not aware of and will never be aware of.

I have placed this funds on what we call escrow call account with no beneficiary. As an officer of this bank I cannot be directly connected to this money, so my aim of contacting you is to assist me receive this money in your bank account and get 30% of the total funds as commission.



There are practically no risks involved, it will be a bank-to-bank transfer, and all I need from you is to stand claim as the original depositor of these funds who made the deposit with my branch so that my head office can order the transfer to your designated bank account.   If you accept to work with me I will appreciate it very much.
