Dear Sir/Ma



Naturally, this letter will come to you as a surprise, since we have not =
met, permit me however, I am Barrister Jonathan Micheal, I am contacting =
you to kindly assist me in the Project below, which will be of mutual ben=
efit to us both.


A salvadorean, Mr. Ramirez Cathy, 66 years of age and a very prosperous f=
armer made a huge bank deposit for investment in the sum of US$17.5 Milli=
on (Seventeen Million, Five hundred Thousand United States Dollars)he nam=
ed his wife Mrs. Helga Cathy as the NEXT OF KIN . I was called upon as an=
 Accredited Attorney to the bank to sign and endorse documents to thisdep=
osit on Mr.Cathy's behalf. Unfortunately, Mr. & Mrs.Cathy were killed in =
theJanuary 14, earthquake that rocked El Salvador, killing thousands ofpe=
ople and 1,200 others were declared missing. The bank management now mand=
ates me (being the lawyer that signed and endorsed the deposit papers for=
 the deceased to trace the family relatives of the deceased so that the f=
und will be released to them.I was made to understand that they had no ch=
ildren. I made several efforts through the El Salvador High Commission in=
 Lagos to contact any of the deceased family relatives, but to no avail. =
Failure to reach any of the family relatives of the deceased,the only opt=
ion left for the Bank's Management is to declare the deceased account dor=
mant and revert the fund on trading and investment in the interestof


the bank.


In order to avoid this development since it has so far been impossible to=
 trace any of the deceased familyrelatives. I now seek your permission an=
d assistance to have you stand as a distant relatives to the deceased.


So that the fund can be released to you and we can use it for ourmutual b=
enefit. I hope you do understand my concern in this matter, if we do not =
use this opportunity to claim this fund,since the deceased relatives cann=
ot be traced, the management of the bank will declare the deceased's acco=
unt dormant and revert the fund on Trading and Investment in the interest=
 of the bank.


For your assistance, you will be compensated adequately with (40%) of the=
m, total sum (55%) will be my own share while (5%) will be set aside to c=
over any incidental expense made both at home and abroad prior to this tr=
ansaction . If you are interested in assisting me with this matter,please=
 send to me urgently via my EMAIL thefollowingdetails below:



*Full name, Company or Private Address




*Telephone and Fax number(s).



Upon receiving the above details from you, I will work out every document=
s/proof representing you as the deceased BONA-FIDE distant relative and w=
hen this is done, you will be contacted by the bankfor the release and co=
llection of this fund, which will be within one week of my receiving the =
above details from you.I will meet with you in your country for disbursem=
ent after the fund might have been released to you and also to discuss in=
vestment potentials as I will like to invest in your country with your as=
sistance.Be assured that this transaction is 100% risk free, as I have ta=
ken all necessary modalities to enable a hitch free transaction.Kindly en=
sure to treat this matter in strict privacy (HighlyConfidential).
