Dear Sir=2FMadam=2C

I beg you to carefully go through this email and should it not meet 
your business or personal ethics=2C please accept my apologies in advance=2E
My name is David Roberts=2C the Chief Executive of Private Clients &
International of the Barclays Group with head office at 54 Lombard 
street=2C London EC3P 3AH=2E 

I am writing this letter to solicit for your support 
and assistance to carry out a project concerning a late customer of the 
bank by name Dr=2E Victor Morgan=2C an oil magnet and philanthropist who died on 
the 14th of June 2002 in the London Hospital after being involved in fatal 
car crash which also claimed the life of his wife and two sons=2E

Lying in his inactive account in one of our branches is the sum of 
Thirty Million United States Dollars=2E Ever since he died the bank has placed a 
stop on all transactions on this account pending when his next of kin would 
come forward for necessary actions=2C identification and collection=2E 
Unfortunately from our investigations and confirmations from his attorney he has no 
family members who are aware of the existence of the money and as such=2C we 
have decided to do business with you=2E

If you stand in as the beneficiary of this funds the money will be 
released to you=2C after the due processes have being followed=2E

Obviously we do not want this money to go into the Bank Treasury 
because the banking law and guideline stipulates that if such fund remains 
unclaimed for 3 years=2C the money will be transferred into the Bank Treasury as 
unclaimed debt=2E This would not take too much time to get done as his lawyer 
already has the necessary Letters of Administration and court orders from the
British high court which are part of the documents required by the 
Barclays bank to process fund release approvals=2E

To do this work 75% of the money will be for our end=2C 20% will be for 
you while 5% will be for any xpenses incurred during the transaction=2E 
Please reach me at my private email address above=2C if willing to do business 
with us=2E

Thanks and regards=2C

David Roberts=2E
