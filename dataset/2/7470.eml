Dear friend,

My name is Barrister Paul BENSON the attorney of late Thompson Morris a
Citizen of United States of America who deposited the sum of
$4.8million US Dollars cash in a DIPLOMATIC SECURITY COMPANY in Europe
I Requested for the release of his funds few months ago before i fell
Sick and also to be transfer to any of his family member/cousin or
Relation which will be you.

The problem that am having at the moment is getting a reliable and
trusted person that will forward   his contact and also
his full name and Identification then i will proceed by Sending a POWER
of ATTORNEY to him and a release letter that will direct the Diplomatic
Security Company to deliver the funds to you either by cash or by Bank
Transfer due to the fact that the funds are deposited in cash. I have
all the documents that prove that the money is not a DRUG money and
also CERTIFICATE OF ANTI-TERRORISE and MONEY LAUDERING.
If you can play the role by sending me your details such as follow:

Full Name:
Contact Address:
Phone Number:
Any Form of ID:

I believe it will be wise enough for us to claim the funds instead of
Leaving it for some group of staffs to share it within them self. The
Late Mr. Thompson is an American, but he died together with his wife
and their only daughter on board Alaska Airline flight number 261, on
31st of January 2000. You can read more about Mr. Morris Thompson and
his family's death by clicking on this:

Mr. Paul BENSON
NB. I have been seriously sick all this while and presently in a
Hospital herein Europe so i am not sure of making it in life do to my
health problem.
