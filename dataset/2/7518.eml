Sir/madam, 
With due respect, trust and humility, I write to you
irrespective of the fact that you do not know me and i
do not know you either, but please do 
consider this letter as a request from a widow and
family in dare need of assistance. 
You may be surprised to receive this letter from me
since you don't know me personally. I am Mrs Kathy
Olds,wife of Late Mr Martin Olds,a famous zimbabwean
tobacco/cattle farmer who was murdered in a farmland
dispute in Zimbabwe.Please gothrough: 
http://www.rte.ie/news/2000/0418/zimbabwe.html 
I got yourcontact through a search on the internet
here in South Africa. I do not know your person but I
am relying on faith to see me through. During the war
waged against the farmers in Zimbabwe by the
supporters and cohorts of President Robert Mugabe to
claim all the white owned farms in our country, my
late husband belonged to one of the classes of farmers
also targeted by the ZANU-PF armed group,because he
did not support theirideas and policies of taking
white farmers 
land by force. 

Blackwar veterans claiming tobe farmers, invaded my
husband's house on April 17, 2000 at about 8.35pm in
Macheke/Virginia district and murdered him because of
his insistence that white farmers be allowed to retain
their farmlands despite the  recently introduced land
reforms"Act" in Zimbabwe by 
the head of state,President Robert Mugabe. 
Until his death he was one of the prominent members of
the Zimbabwean Farmers'Union (ZFU)But before my
husbands death, he first escaped safely into
neighbouring South Africa with his life time fortune
of US$37m(Thirty-seven Million 
USdollars)cash, important documents of property title
and other 
valuables which were concealed and secured in a trunk
box, and 
transported to Johannesburg through diplomatic means. 
The consignment box is currently safely lodged and
secured in the vaults of a private security firm here
in Johannesburg after which he returned to zimbabwe
while he was killed. The fund was meant for the
purchase of new tractors,machinery and agro-allied
chemicals for our new farms acquired in Swaziland. 
This land problem came when President  Robert Mugabe
introduced a new land act"ModusOperandi" reform which
wholly affected the rich white farmers. A lot of
people were killed because of this land reforms "Act"
of which my late husband was one of the main
targets.Based on this,I had to flee the country with
my 
two children and my only late husband personal
assistance [PA] Mr Chris Mutembi who was his personal
assistant{PA}. 
We are now in south africa as political assylum
seekers/refugees. 
We decided to contact you to assist us in removing
this money my husband kept in a private security
company here in south africa to your account or any
part of the world for investments as the
monetary/investment laws here in south africa
prohibits refugees and illegal immigrants from
operating bank accounts or be involved in any
transaction/investment. Based on this, 
we are contacting you hoping that you will assist us
with this transaction. 
As a widow, I am saddled with the responsibility of
seeking a genuine and an honest person who will assist
us in investing this money in a highly profit yeilding
ventures without the knowledge of my
country(Zimbabwe)government who are bent on taking
everything my late husband 
had after confiscating all his farmlands and
investments in Zimbabwe 
. 
We are absolutely left with nothing except the money
he deposited in a private security company here in
south africa. In recognition of investment
opportunities that abound in so many contries in the
world , I solicit for your 
assistance to us by moving my family money into your
country/ bank account for safekeeping pending our
future arrival for investments in your country or
elsewhere you may wish. 
The family has resolved to adequately offer a share 
of 15% of the money to you for your involvement and
assistance to our family in moving the entire money
out of SouthAfrica. 
Please call  Mr Chris Mutembi on telephone 
number+27-738151680 [or] send him a fax on fax number
+27-11-5075944
for further briefing on what you need to do, 
if my letter and request is of any interest to you.
while I implore you to maintain
absolute confidentiality required in this transaction
considering our situation here in south africa. If
not, then I humbly apologise for this infringement on
your privacy. 
Respectfully, 
Mrs Kathy Olds.
