Hi,

This is Vasil Nanchev. I just wanted to inform you about something
which is really time sensitive. For the first time in 20 years,
America is going to witness the launch of a new nationwide
newspaper. "THE USA TIMES" will launch on Jan. 1 2004, and
the
promotion is on now. You can join for free and bring other members
into the program to get a great residual income for life. They are
promoting it through MLM and paying on 5 levels. This is going to
get huge and people who act now will be earning a lot of money in
the years to come.

Don't waste time and sign-up at

As soon as you sign-up (for free), just contact me and I will tell
you how to get other people to join the program. If only 10 people
(which could be your friends, family members or co-workers)
sign-up
under you, you can make thousands of dollars every month without
doing any work. It's true! 

I am really excited and I am sure you will be too after you read
the complete details.
