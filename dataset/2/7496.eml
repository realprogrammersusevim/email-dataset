Compliment Of The Season,

On a very good day. I am (bala tomson Esq),the Head of file Department in
African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist
search.

When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability
and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to Go=
d
or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 1=
5
million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account
that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entir=
e
family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we got
information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin to
come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless somebod=
y
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicated in
our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his supposed
next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash leavin=
g
nobody behind for the claim.

 It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my
department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release
the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safet=
y
and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t
want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained
unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in
this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner=
,
and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We agree that
30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in respect to the
provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for expenses
incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman
colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement
according to the percentages indicated.

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as
arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of
the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your
private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and
location where the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text o=
f
the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this
transaction is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of
fear as all required arrangements have been made for thetransfer.

You should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon
as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately.  Your=92=
s
faithfully,

BALA TOMSON (Esq.)


POST SCRITUM:You have to keep everything secret as to enable the transfer
to move very smoothly in to the account you will prove to the bank.As you
finished reading this letter call me immediately so that we discuss very
well over this business.
