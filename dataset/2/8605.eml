Good Day!
I hope my email meets you well. I am in need of your assistance. My name is
Mr. MARK LEE. I am in charge of Administration, London Office of the
Engineering military unit, in Ba'qubah in Iraq, operating from our office i=
n
London, UK. We have about $25 Million US dollars that we want to move out o=
f
Iraq. My partner who is a south african citizen by name Dr p c smith,privat=
e
telephone +27 73 216 99 59 and we
need a good partner that we can trust. This money is genareted from oil
and it is legal.
But the only way we can move the money is through diplomatic means,not to
london for security reason but to africa first before transferring to an ba=
nk of
your choice. The most important thing is can we trust you? Once the funds
get to you, you will take 20% of the total sum,while 75% will be for us.the
5% stands to cover all expenses.
Your own part of this deal is to give us all assistance needed
 If you are interested I will furnish you with more
details. But the whole process is simple and we must keep a low profile at
all times.
I look forward to your reply and co-operation, and I thank you in
advance as I anticipate your co-operation. You can reach me on via email:
mrmark_lee1@yahoo.co.uk.
Waiting for your urgent response.
Regards,
Mr. MARK LEE
