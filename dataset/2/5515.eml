Dear friend,=20
It is indeed my pleasure to write to you this letter,=20
which I believe will be a suprise,as we are both=20
complete strangers.=20
As you read this, I don't want you to feel sorry for=20
me, because I believe everyone will die someday. My=20
name is Miguel Wayne, a former merchant in Dubai, in the=20
U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer=20
which was discovered very late, due to my laxity in=20
caring for my health.=20
It has defiled all forms of medicine, and right now I=20
have only about a few months to live, according to=20
medical experts. I have not particularly lived my life=20
so well, as I never really cared for anyone not even=20
myself but my business.Though I am very rich, I was=20
never generous,I was always hostile to people and only=20
focus on my business as that was the only thing I=20
cared for,but now I regret all this as I now know that=20
there is more to life than just wanting to have or=20
make all the money in the world.=20
I believe when I have a second chance to come to this=20
world I would live my life a different way from how I=20
had lived it, now that it is dark for me, I have=20
willed and given most of my properties and assets to=20
my immediate and extended family members and as well=20
as a few close friends.=20
To correct my wrong past life, I have decided to give=20
alms to charity organizations,as I want this to be one=20
of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have=20
distributed money to some charity organizations in the=20
U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has=20
deteriorated so badly,I cannot do this my self=20
anymore.=20
I once asked members of my family to close one of my=20
accounts and distribute the money which I have there=20
to charity organization in Bulgaria and Pakistan, they=20
refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do=20
not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have
left for them. The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cas=
h
deposit of four million dollars that I have with a Fiducial Company Abroa=
d,
I will want you to help me collect this deposit and dispatched it to char=
