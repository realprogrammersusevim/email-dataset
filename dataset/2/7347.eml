DEAR PARTNER,
IN ORDER TO TRANSFER OUT ( FIFTEEN-MILLION POUNDS
STERLINGS) FROM OUR 
BANK HERE IN LONDON. I HAVE THE COURAGE TO LOOK FOR A
RELIABLE AND HONEST PERSON WHO WILL BE CAPABLE FOR THIS
IMPORTANT BUSINESS TRANSACTION,BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL
NEVER LET ME DOWN EITHER NOW OR IN FUTURE.
THE OWNER OF THIS ACCOUNT IS MR JOHN HUGHES A FOREIGNER AND
THE MANAGER
OF PETROL CHEMICAL SERVICE HERE IN LONDON,A CHEMICAL
ENGINEER BY 
PROFFESSION AND HE DIED SINCE 1995.THE ACCOUNT HAS NO OTHER
BENEFICIARY AND MY INVESTIGATION PROVED TO ME AS WELL THAT
HIS COMPANY DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS ACCOUNT AND
THE AMOUNT INVOLVED IS (15,000,000.00)POUNDS STERLINGS.
I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT
ABROAD BUT I 
DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER,I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME
TO YOU AS A 
SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OUR SELF BEFORE,BUT BE SURE THAT
IT IS REAL AND A GENUINE BUSINESS.I BELIEVE IN GOD THAT YOU
WILL NEVER LET ME DOWN IN THIS INVESTMENT.
YOUR FULL CONTACT PHONE AND FAX NUMBER NAME WILL BE
NECESSARY FOR THIS 
EFFECT.
