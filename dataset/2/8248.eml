From: Mr Ali Sherif. African Development Bank (ADB)Ouagadougou , Burkina Fa=
so .=20
Dear Friend,=20
I Am The Manager Of Foreign Remittance And Exchange Dept At African Develop=
ment Bank (ADB). Burkina- Faso, West Africa .
In my department we discover an abandoned sum of Usd$12.6m Dollars (Twelve =
Million, Six Hundred Thousand Us Dollar). In an account that belongs to one=
 of our foreign customer who died alongside with his entire family in a pla=
ne crash the year 2001 that took the whole life of the passengers on board.
=20
Since we got information about his death, the bank have been expecting his =
next of kin to come over and claim his money because the bank cannot releas=
e it unless someone applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceas=
ed as indicating in our banking guideline, but unfortunately we learnt that=
 all his supposed next of kin or relation that knows about the account info=
rmation died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind fo=
r the claim.
=20
It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this busines=
s proposal to you and for the money to be release to you as the next of kin=
 or relation to the deceased, since nobody will ever come for it, we do not=
 want this money to go into the treasury of the bank as unclaimed bill or f=
und.
=20
the bank law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained uncl=
aimed after six years, the money will be transferred into the bank treasury=
 account as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this=
 transaction is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner an=
d a citizen cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.
In subsequent disbursement of the money, I agree that 40% of this money wil=
l be for you in respect of the provision you made by standing in the claim =
as next of kin,10% will be set aside for expenses in cure during  the trans=
action on taxes that will arise and 50% would be for me.
As soon as the money hit into your account I will come over to your country=
 for disbursement according to the percentages indicated above.
To make the claim, you will first of all apply to the bank by sending a tex=
t of application which I will send to you for you to fill and send to the b=
ank. In the application you will indicate your bank account, your private f=
ax and your private telephone number for easy and effective communication.
=20
Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by email the text of applica=
tion which you will send to the bank. I will not fail to bring to your noti=
ce that this transaction is hitch free and you do not entertain any atom of=
 fear as all required arrangements have been made for the success of the tr=
ansfer.=20
=20
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter.
Hoping to hear from you immediately.           PLANE CRASH WEB SITE... http=
