;&nbsp; Compliment Of The Season, </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>On a very good day. I am (Prince&nbsp; Hassan Esq),The Head =
of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact fr=
om Yahoo tourist search.</STRONG></DIV><STRONG>
<DIV><BR>When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your cap=
ability and reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i pray=
ed to God or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned =
sum of $ 15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In a=
n account that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with=
 his entire family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. Since we =
got information about his death, we have been expecting his next of kin t=
o come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless someb=
ody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as indicate=
d in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that all his sup=
posed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the plane crash =
leaving nobody behind for the claim. </DIV>
<DIV>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV>It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official in my de=
partment now decided to make this businness proposal to you and release t=
he money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety=
 and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we don=92t=
 want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.</STRONG>=
</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such m=
oney remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered int=
o the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next o=
f kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a =
foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. We=
 agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in res=
pect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for ex=
penses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman =
colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement accordi=
ng to the percentages indicated. </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG><BR>Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund=
 to you as arranged, you must apply first to the bank as relations or nex=
t of kin of the deceased indicating your bank name, your bank account num=
ber, your private telephone and fax number for easy and effective communi=
cation and location where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your=
 reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of the application I =
will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free=
 and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required arran=
gements have been made for thetransfer. </STRONG></DIV>
<DIV><STRONG></STRONG>&nbsp;</DIV>
<DIV><STRONG>You should contact me on my number <FONT color=3D#ff40ff>002=
26-7885 75 97</FONT>, immediately as soon as you receive this letter. Tru=
sting to hear from you immediately. <BR>Your=92s faithfully, </STRONG></D=

<DIV><STRONG><U><FONT color=3D#007500>POST SCRITUM</FONT></U>:You have to=
 keep everything secret as to enable the transfer to move very smoothly i=
n to the account you will prove to the bank.As you finished reading this =
letter call me immediately so that we discuss very well over this busines=
