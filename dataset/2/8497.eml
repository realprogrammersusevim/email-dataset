Dear sir/madam,
this mail will definitely be coming to you as a surprise, but i must 
crave your indulgence to introduce myself to you.
I am Miss Marah sadija, former mistress to the son (Qusay) of the Iraqi former leader, Saddam Hussein.
I am an Ethiopian, by birth and i am presently in a refugee camp in  Zimbabwe,where the living conditions are unbearable.
I do not wish to take your time with a lenghty mail, but i have to put this proposal to you so that you can assist me.
While i was still in contact with Qusay,he made a deposit in my
name to a security firm in Spain, which has an affiliate branch in 
Amsterdam.
This deposit was made in my name and the secret code and necessary  documents are presently in the possession of an attorney, presently in London.
This deposit was made in the form of a consigment and the content is a considerable amount of money in United state dollars which i cannot  disclose to you for security purposes, until you have confirmed your willingness to assist me.
I would be pleased and grateful to you if you could assist me in 
collecting this consignment on my behalf from the security firm in Spain, upon  which i will be offering you a percentage for your efforts.
The attorney in London, will arrange an authority to release and pay in your name which you will tender to the security firm coupled with all necessary documents that will back up your claims in collecting this consignment  on my behalf.
I have to stop here now as your response will determine our
subsequent corresspondence. Please feel free to dis-regard this 
proposal if it is not in line with your principles.
PLEASE RESPOND TO sadijjam@yahoo.co.in
Allah bless you,
Marah Sadija.
