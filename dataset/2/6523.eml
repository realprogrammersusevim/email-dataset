Dear Friend,               
I am contacting you to front as a co-owner of my late
husband's company and beneficiary of funds
(US$25,000,000.00)due the company.
I am currently a high ranking government official in
the ruling cabinet of President Thabo Mbeki (South
Africa). I am a widow and mother of two children.My
late husband Mr Ronald Tshabalala died 1996.
After his death, I recently discovered that an
over-invoiced proceeds of a contract I helped his
company secured is yet to be paid out by the Reserve
Bank of South Africa. 
This funds emanated as a result of an over-invoiced
contract which my husband's company executed with the
Government of South Africa.I am afraid that the
government of South Africa might start to investigate
on contracts awarded from 1995 to date. If they
discover this money yet unclaimed with my husband's
name linked to it, the government will confiscate the
money and seize his assets here in South Africa and
this will definately affect my political career in
Government.

I want your assistance to front as a co-owner of his
company (Tshabalala Construction, LTD) to facilitate
the release of the funds. I will introduce a very good
attorney to assist us with the transfer process
without any hitch but he will not be told my interest
in the transaction as I play a very sensitive role in
my government. 
As the contract was executed in my present government
department, be rest assured that I will use my
position to approve the immediate release of the
entitlement. As soon as the funds is released to your
name, you are expected to move it immediately into
your personal bank account in your country. As soon as
you have confirmed receipt of the funds into your
account, I will arrange to meet with you.

If you agree to my proposal, please endeavour to send
me an urgent reply. Due to my sensitive position in
the South African Government, I would not want you to
phone or fax me. All correspondence must be through my
private mail address 

The lawyer I will recommend to assist us will be
representing our interest at the Reserve Bank of South
Africa and all necessary quarters. All future
correspondence must be made either to the attorney or
myself. 
I am reposing huge trust on you regardless of your
being a total stranger. Upon your reply, we shall
dicuss your percentage for your assistance.
Because of my sensitive position as serving government
official, I will only give you more details of myself
when we proceed further and am sure of your
personality.
Honesty and transparency, they are my best work tools.
Thank you.
Mrs Stella Sigcau.
MINISTER OF PUBLIC WORKS.
