Attn: Sir/Madam,

{HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL}
(RE: TRANSFER OF (THIRTY SIX 
MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND
FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS STERLINGS)
RE: 
TRANSFER OF 36,759,000.00 MILLION POUNDS TO YOUR
ACCOUNT.
My name is Mr.
Jason Leicester and I work in the International Operation Department in 
a Bank here in London.I feel quite safe dealing with you in this 
important business.Though, this medium (Internet) has been greatly 
abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the 
fastest medium of communication. However, this correspondence is 
unofficial and private, and it should be treated as such. 

At first I 
will like to assure you that this transaction is 100% risk and trouble 
free to both parties. WE WANT TO TRANSFER OUT MONEY FROM OUR BANK HERE 
IN LONDON. THE FUND FOR TRANSFER IS OF CLEAN ORIGIN. THE OWNER OF THIS 
ACCOUNT IS A FOREIGNER, a program leader.Until his death,The Late Prime
Minister, Mr. Rafik Hariri, has a huge investment here in the United 
Kingdom and all over the world, as a matter of fact he has the sum of
(THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS 
STERLINGS) in his account here in London which he deposited as a family 
valuables.The family do not know about this deposit.I was on a routine 
inspection that I discovered a dormant domiciliary account with a BAL. 
Of (THIRTY SIX MILLION SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE THOUSAND POUNDS 
STERLINGS) on further discreet investigation, I also discovered that 
the account holder has passed away (dead) leaving no beneficiary to the 
account. The bank will approve this money to any foreigner because the 
former operator of the a/c is a foreigner. I am certainly sure that 
nobody will come again for the claim of this money. A foreigner can 
only claim this money with legal claims to the account Holder, 

Therefore I need your cooperation in this transaction. I will provide 
all necessary information needed in order to claim this money.Hoping in 
God that you will never let me down now and in future.o.k! Rafik Bahaa 
Edine Hariri (November 1, 1944 - February 14, 2005), married to Nazek 
Audi Hariri, was a Lebanese self-made billionaire and business tycoon, 
and was five times Prime Minister of Lebanon (1992-1998 and 2000-2004) 
before his last resignation from office on October 20,
2004. The late 
Rafik Hariri died on February 14, 2005 when explosives equivalent to 
around 300 kg of C4 were detonated as his motorcade drove past the 
Saint George Hotel i n the Lebanese capital, for more information 
please log on to (http://www.hariri.info/)

I WANT TO TRANSFER THIS 
MONEY INTO A SAFE FOREIGN ACCOUNT ABROAD BUT I DON'T KNOW ANY FOREIGNER 
WHOM I CAN TRUST, I KNOW THAT THIS MESSAGE WILL COME TO YOU AS A 
SURPRISE AS WE DON'T KNOW OURSELVES BEFORE, BUT BE SURE THAT IT IS REAL 
AND A GENUINE BUSINESS. I CONTACT YOU BELIEVING THAT YOU WILL NOT LET 
ME DOWN ONCE THE FUND GOES INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.

Best Regards 

Mr.Jason 
Leicester .
