the richest man in Russia and owner of the following companies: Chairman
CEO: YUKOS OIL (Russian Largest Oil Company) Chairman CEO: Menatep SBP Ba=
nk

rld).
I seek your partnership to accommodate the sum US$423M for us.

My Boss got arrested for his involvement on politics in financing the lea=
ding
and opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces, led by Boris
Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor Yav=
linsky)
which posed treat to President Vladimir Putin second tenure as Russian pr=
esident
before he was reelected On March 14, 2004. You can catch more of the stor=
y
on this

The fund (US$423M) in question was approved by the Government of Russia
for payment of various YUKOS OIL contractors/suppliers to prevent them fr=
om
loosing the money they invested in the numerous contracts they executed
for the above firm. The Government had already concluded plans to frozen
all the accounts in my boss name (Mikhail Khodorkovsky) both corporate an=
d
personal before I connived with the Accountant General of YUKOS OIL (who
is also my partner in this transaction) to raise a memo stating that YUKO=
S
OIL owe contractors the above amount which was finally approved for payme=
nt
after some deliberations. Actually, we have paid all our contractors both=

local and foreign because they agitated for their payment when they had
that my boss was arrested.

YOUR ROLE:

I will present you / your company as one of the contractors we are owing
so that you can stand as the beneficiary of the above quoted sum or part
of the fund according to your financial strength or the strength of your
company. I will arrange for the documentation which the payee bank will
need to transfer the sum to you. I have decided to use this sum to reloca=
te
to American continent and never to be connected to any of Mikhail Khodork=
ovsky
conglomerates. The transaction has to be concluded before as soon as poss=
ible.
You will be rewarded with 10% of the total sum for your partnership. Can
you be our partner on this transacton?

As soon as I get your willingness to assist us in this deal, I will give
you more details. Thank you very much .

NOTE: PLEASE REPLY TO THIS MAIL kimaeva@k.ro.

Regards

MS.KIMAEVA LIOUDMILA
