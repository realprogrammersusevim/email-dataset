Hello,
I am Mr. Usman Ramat Shehu, Manager with UNITED BANK FOR AFRICAN PLC(U.B.A.=
).I have a confidential business proposition for you. Our Bank is a=20
financial institution specialising in private banking to individual custome=
rs who likes confidentiality in their financial dealings.I have intrest of =
investing in your company as such i would like to make contact with you for=
 assistance.
On January 13,1987 an Indian-American mining consultant with the=20
Petrogas Gas Systems BV Environmental Systems, Mr. Dixit Shanti made a numb=
ered time (Fixed) Deposit for Twenty Four calendar months, valued at=20
US$49,500,000.00 (Forty Nine million, Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars) i=
n the Bank. Upon maturity, I sent a routine notification to his forwarding =
address but=20
got no reply. After a month, we sent a reminder and finally we discovered f=
rom
his contract employers, that Mr. Dixit Shanti died in the 1988 Lockerbie=20
flight Pan Am 103 plane crash. On further investigation, I found out that h=
e=20
died intestate (without making a WILL), and all attempts to trace his=20
next-of-kin had been fruitless.Please see
http://www.geocities.com/capitolhill/5260/passlist.html
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr. Dixit=20
Shanti did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents w=
ith
us, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$49,500,000.00 is still sitting in my Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year.
Consequently, my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to=20
stand in as the next of kin to Mr. Dixit Shanti.
This is simple, I will like you to provide your full names and home or
office including your telephone and fax numbers so that I can seek the
services of a lawyer/Attorney to prepare the necessary documents and
court affidavits which will put you in good standing as the=20
next-of-kin.
A bank account in any part of the world which you will provide later=20
will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the=20
beneficiary/next of kin. The money will be paid into your account for us to=
 share in the=20
ratio of 80% for me and 20% for you.
Be informed that in other to provide more legality and legitimacy to=20
this project, the paperworks for this will be done by the Attorney and my=
=20
position as the head of bills and exchange guarantees the successful execut=
ion=20
of this transaction. If you are interested, please
revert back to me.
Please observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall=20
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.If you are capab=
le and intrested to do this business with me you reply me in this my email =
address: usmanramat1@web-mail.com.ar
Thanks and regards.
Mr. Usman Ramat Shehu
