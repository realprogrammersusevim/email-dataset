FROM THE DESK OF MR.MOHMED YAYA.
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING MANAGER,
AFRICA DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)
OUAGADOUGOU-BURKINA FASO.

Dear Friend,



I am the AUDITIING AND ACCOUNTING MANAGER AFRICA DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)=
 here in Ouagadougou,Burkina Faso.In my department we discovered an aba=
ndoned sum of USD$15.5m(Fifteen million Five hundred thousand united st=
ates dollars).in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customer=
(MR.ARTHUR BILLINGS from AMERICA,USA)who died along with his entire fam=
ily in Monday,31 July,2000,in a plane crash.FOR MORE INFORMATION VISIT =
THIS SITE BELOW:

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm



Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his=20=

next of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release =
it unlessn some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the d=
eceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and laws but unfortunatel=
y we learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongsid=
e with him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.



It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this bus=
inessproposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or=
 relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since =
nobody is coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the ban=
k treasury as unclaimed bill.The banking law and guidline here stipulat=
es that if such money remained unclaimed after fours years, the money w=
ill be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund.



The request of foreigner as next of kin in this business is occassioned=
 by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and a Burkinabe cannot s=
tand as next of kin to a foreigner.
I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a respect to the prov=
ision of a foriegn account , 10% will be set aside for expenses incurre=
d during the business and 60% would be for me hereafter, I will visit y=
our country for disbursement according to the percentage indicated Ther=
efore, to enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you arranged,yo=
u must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceas=
ed indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private te=
lephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and locatio=
n where in the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I wil=
l send to you by fax or email the text of application .



I will not fail to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free=20=

and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required=20
arrangements have been made for the transfer.
You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this=20
letter.Trusting to hear from you immediately.
