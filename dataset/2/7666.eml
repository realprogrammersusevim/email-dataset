I contacted you based on trust to assist me in repatriating his money
and property he left behind, before they get confiscated or declared
unserviceable by the Security Company where his huge deposit was lodged.

Particularly, the deceased has an Amount of $12.6 million dollars,
after my written notification about the death of the deceased to the
security Company they have issued me a notice to provide the next of
kin or
have the Funds confiscated within the next 60 days.
Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives all this
while, that's why I seek your consent to assert you as the next of kin
of
the deceased, so that the proceeds of this Amount valued at $12.6
million
dollars can be paid to you as the bonafide approved Next of Kin by the
security Company.
If you agree the money will be shared in a ratio of 75% for me while 20%=3D=


for you and 5% will set aside for any expenses incured during the transfe=
