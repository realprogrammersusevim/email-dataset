Dear Sir=2C

RE=3A BUSINESS PROPOSAL - STRICTLY CONFIDENTIAL=2E

I am CHIEF=28DR=2E=29BODE GEORGE=2E=2C Chairman to the Contract Review 
Panel that was recently inaugurated by the President of the Federal 
Republic of Nigeria to review the activities of past military government with 
particular reference to contracts awarded by all ministries between 1990 
to 1999=2E In the course of carrying out our assigned duties=2C we discovered 
the sum of USD40=2E5 =28forty million=2C five hundred thousand dollars=29 only lying 
idle in a suspense account with our apex bank=2E This funds emanated from 
grossly over-invoiced contracts awarded to conglomerate of foreign firms 
by the Petroleum Ministry on behalf of the Nigerian National Petroleum 
Corporation=2E On completion of our assignment=2C this amount was 
deliberately not included in our report because we want to capitalize on 
this once in a lifetime opportunity to benefit and make a fortune out of it=2E 
The only option we have to achieve our aims and objective is to have this 
fund transferred to a country of our choice where it can be kept in trust 
and safe custody for us=2E We are however handicapped at the moment by 
our status as civil servants=2C which barred us from operating foreign 
accounts while still in government service=2E

Thus=2C through some discreet inquiries from our Chambers of Commerce=2C 
you and your organization were revealed as being quite astute in private 
entrepreneurship=2E On this premise=2C we have no doubt in your ability to 
handle a business of this nature=2C which informed our desire and wish to 
enter into a partnership with you=2E This business involves the remittance of 
this amount into your bank account with the hope of travelling down to 
meet you physically in order to receive our share=2E We hope to invest some 
in profitable ventures in your country based on your advise while the 
balance will be repatriated home as foreign earnings=2E We have mapped 
out strategies and all paperwork is in place to ensure a 100% success=2E

The nature of your business at present does not really matter because in 
the world over=2C bigger firms do bid for big contracts especially in third world 
countries like ours and can subcontract part of it to other firms for 
execution=2E That is you or your firm will be regarded as one of those that 
executed one of such projects and therefore entitled to receive the over-
invoiced amount of the contract value since the original contractor has 
been paid=2E Be rest assured that this transaction is 100% risk free as there 
is actually no risk is involved either now or in the future for we are well 
connected in official circle=2E Given our level of commitment at the moment=2C 
we want to assure you that with full dedication on your part=2C the objective 
of having this fund remitted would have been realized within a period of 
two weeks=2E It is hereby expressly agreed in principle that at the end of the 
transaction=2C you will be entitled to 25% of the entire sum=2C 75% will be for 
my colleagues and I=2E

If you are interested in this proposal=2C please call or send me an e-mail 
VIA=3Abode=5Fgeorge=40xuppa=2Ecom for more clarifications=2E If however 
you are not interested=2C still let me know to enable me search for someone 
else to carry out this business with=2E

I anticipate a timely response from you=2E

Thanks=2E

Yours Sincerely=2C

CHIEF=28DR=2E=29BODE GEORGE
