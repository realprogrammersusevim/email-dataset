Greetings, 

My name is Rabi Al salih, wife of MAHAMMED MAHDI AL SALIH,the former 
Iraqi minister for Interior Affairs. I got your email address through 
the internet while searching for a reliable person to help me and I 
believe you can be able to help me and my family.
 
My husband was captured on 23 April 2003 by the US forces. My husband 
is presently in jail and facing trial on charges of terrorism, 
corruption, embezzlement and the mysterious charge of plunder which 
might lead to death sentence. During my husband's regime as Minister 
for Interior, I realized some reasonable amount of money from various 
deals that I successfully executed. I have plans to invest this money 
for my children's future on real estate and industrial production. My 
husband is not aware of this because I wish to do it secretly for 
now. 

Before the US invaded our nation, I secretly siphoned the sum of 
$12,000,000 million USD out of Iraq and deposited the money with a 
security firm that transports valuable goods and consignments through 
diplomatic means. I also declared that the consignment was solid gold 
belonging to my foreign business partner. I am contacting you because 
I want you to go to the security company and claim the money on my 
behalf since I have declared that the consignment belong to my 
foreign business partner. You shall also be required to assist me in 
investment in your country. 

I trust you as a reliable person who will not sit on this money when 
you claim it, rather assist me properly I expect you to declare what 
percentage of the total money you will take for your assistance. when 
I receive your positve response I will give you all the necessary 
informations to enable you proceed to the security company and claim 
the money. I shall also let you know where the security company is 
and the consignment pin code to claim the consignment, which is very 
important. I assure you 100% safety and success once you follow my 
instructions.

For now, let all our communication be by e-mail because my line are 
tight now connected to the US Forces Telecomunication Network 
services. Please also send me your telephone and fax number. I will 
give more details when I receive your reply.

Yours Sincerely,
Rabi.
