NOTIFICATION OF BEQUEST=2E 

Dear Sir=2C 

On behalf of the Trustees and Executor of the Estate of Late Mr=2E Edwin Gabriel=2C I once again try to notify you as my earlier letter were returned undelivered=2E

I hereby=2C attempted to reach you again by this same email address on the WILL but could not yet go through hence I decided to reach you by email probably if you could receive it this time=2E 

May=2C I notify you that late Mr=2E Edwin Gabriel made you a beneficiary to his WILL=2E Hence=2C he left the sum of Nine Million One Hundred Thousand Dollars =28USD$9=2C100=2E000=2E00=29 to you in the codicil and last testament to his will=2E 

This may sound strange and unbelievable to you=2C but it is real and true=2E Being a widely raveled man=2C he must have been in contact with you in the past or simply you were nominated to him by one of his numerous friends abroad who wished you good=2E

Mr=2E Edwin Gabriel until his death was a member of the Helicopter Society and the Institute of Electronic & Electrical Engineers=2E He was a very dedicated Christian and he also loves Muslim brothers who loved to give out=2E His great philanthropy earned him numerous awards during his lifetime=2E Late Mr=2E Edwin Gabriel died on the 16th day of February 2005 at the age of 90 years=2C and his WILL is now ready for execution=2E

According to him=2C this money is to support your Christian activities and to help the poor and the needy=2C as I have made an arrangement with a diplomat=2C attached to my Office=2C to help you deliver this fund directly at your doorstep=2C since transferring the fund through bank-to-bank transfer might demand for a lot of money which you have spent and almost gone bankrupt=2C yet=2C to no avail=2E 


Please if I reach you as I am hopeful=2C endeavor to get back to me as soon as possible to enable me conclude my job=2C as I hope to hear from you in no distant time=2E 

Yours in His service!
