and I want to count on you for reliability and
trustworthiness and I also want you to handle this
Issue I am about to disclose to you as confidential,

until his death, the Paramount Chief of Lofa County 
also an Independent Diamond Mineral & Merchant. He
died in March 13, 1999 after a brief illness at the
age of 70.One day after my father's death, I was going
through his under ground save when I saw some very
Important Documents which reveals to me that my Late
father has deposited one trunk of consignment box of
