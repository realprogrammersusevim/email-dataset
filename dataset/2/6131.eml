Compliment Of The Season, 

On a very good day. I am (bala tomson Esq),the Head of file Department in=
 African developent bank (ADB).I got your contact from Yahoo tourist sear=
ch.
When i was searching for a foreign partner i assured of your capability a=
nd reliability to champion this businees opportunity when i prayed to God=
 or Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ =
15 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account=
 that belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his enti=
re family in (Monday 31st July 2000) in a plane crash. 

Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next=
 of kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unl=
ess somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as=
 indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately we learnt that al=
l his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the pla=
ne crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. 

 It is therefore upon this discovery that I and one official 
in my department now decided to make this businness proposal to you and r=
elease the money to you as the next of kin or relation to the deceased fo=
r safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it and we=
 don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill.

The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such money remained=
 unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered into the Bank tr=
easury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this=
 business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner, an=
d a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. 

We agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in r=
espect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for =
expenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woma=
n colleague. 
There after i will visit your country for disbursement
according to the percentages indicated. 

Therefore to enable the immediate trnansfer of this fund to you as arrang=
ed, you must apply first to the bank as relations or next of kin of the d=
eceased indicating your bank name, your bank account number, your private=
 telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and locati=
on where the money will be remitted.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text o=
f the application I will not fail to bring to your notice that this trans=
action is hitch free and that you should not entertain any atom of fear a=
s all required arrangements have been made for the transfer. 


You should contact me on my number (00226-7885 75 97) immediately as soon=
 as you receive this letter. Trusting to hear from you immediately. 

 Your's faithfully, 
BALA TOMSON (Esq.)
