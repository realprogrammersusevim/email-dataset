which I seek your partnership in accommodating for me.
You will be rewarded with 40% of the total sum for
your partnership. Can you be my partner on this?

The money in question was realised during my period of
work with my boss for a peroid spanning 20 years.
Already the funds have been deposited some where in
the UK (undisclosed for now), where the final 
crediting is expected to be carried out. While I was
on the process, My Boss got arrested for his
involvement on politics in financing the
leading and opposing political parties (the Union of
Right Forces, led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a
liberal/social democratic party led by Gregor
Yavlinsky) which poses treat to President Vladimir

YOUR ROLE:

All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of
the above quoted sum and I will arrange for the
documentation which will enable transfer of the sum to
you. I have decided to use this sum to relocate to
American continent and never to be connected to any of
Mikhail Khodorkovsky conglomerates. You can read more
