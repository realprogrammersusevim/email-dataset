Attention: President C.E.O


                                                      URGENT FINANCIAL 
ASSISTANCE

I know you will be surprised to hear from me since you dont know me 
personally. I am WILLIAM ZUNGU , the son of Dr. ZUNGU who was recently 
murdered in the land dispute in Zimbabwe. I got your contact through your 
countrys Information Exchange in my search for a reliable and reputable 
person to handle a very confidential transaction, which involves a transfer 
of fund into a foreign account and I decided to write to you. The war 
veterans of the ruling Government of President Robert Mugabe for their 
alleged support murdered my late father among the few black Zimbabwean rich 
farmers in cold blood for the Movement of Democratic Change (MDC), which is 
against Mugabes rule.

The land problem arose when Mugabe introduced a New Land Act that wholly 
affected the rich white farmers and some blacks vehemently condemned the  
modus operadi adopted by the government.

This resulted to rampart killings and mob action by the war veterans and 
thugs. More than 78 people have so far been killed. Heads of Government from 
the West, especially Britain and United States of America have voiced their 
condemnation of Mugabes Land Act. Subsequently, South Africa Development 
Community (SADC) has continuously supported Mugabe. It is against this 
background that my family and I who are currently in South Africa have 
decided to transfer this money out of Africa as we no longer feel safe 
anymore and want to transfer this money to a foreign country where we can 
establish ourselves.

Just before my fathers death, he took me to Johannesburg, South Africa to 
deposit the sum of US$30.0000.00 (THIRTY MILION UNITED STATE DOLLARS) with a 
security and finance company, as he foresaw the looming danger in Zimbabwe. 
This money was deposited in a box as valuables to avoid much demurrage from 
the finance company. This amount was embarking for the purchase of new farms 
machinery and chemicals, as well as the establishment of some new farms in 
Lesotho and Swaziland.

As the eldest son of my father, I am saddled with the responsibility of 
seeking for genuine foreign account where this money could be transferred 
into without knowledge of my government who are tactically freezing our 
familys wealth and the South African government seems to be playing along. 
I am faced with the dilemma of investing the money here since both countries 
have almost the same history. More so, the South African Foreign Exchange 
does not allow such investments as I am seeking for asylum.

As a businessperson whom I have to entrust my future and that of my family, 
I must let you know that there is no risk and the nature of your business 
does not necessarily matter. Therefore, should you be able and willing to 
help me and my family, we are willing to offer you 30% of the total sum for 
your assistance, 10% will be set aside for expenses we may incur while the 
rest 60% will be for my family. It is our wish to invest our money on 
commercial property based on your advice and I will also receive assurance 
that you would not sit on this money when transferred into your account.

If this proposal is acceptable by you, please confirm your interest via my 
EMAIL.please i want you to include your private telephone number for easy 
communication.


Best regards,
William
