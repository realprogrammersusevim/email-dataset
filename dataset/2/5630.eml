to claim his funds of usd=2E20=2E5 m=2C =5Btwenty million
five hundred thousand united states dollars=5D which
has been with my branch for a very long time=2E 

On this note=2C I decided to seek for whom his name shall
be used as the next of kin as no one has come up to
be the next of kin and the banking ethics here does
not allow such money to stay more than Six years=2C
because money will be recalled to the bank treasury
as unclaimed after this period=2E In view of this I
got your contact through a trade journal after
realizing that your name and country is similar to
the deceased=2E I will give you 25% of the total=2E Upon
the receipt of your response=2C I will send you by fax
or e-mail the application=2C bank's fax number and the
next step to take=2E 


I will not fail to bring to your
notice that this business is hitch free and that you
should not entertain any fear as all modalities for
fund transfer can be finalized within five banking
days=2C after you apply to the bank as a relation to
the deceased=2E When you receive this letter=2E Kindly Call me on my private telephone number at=3A234-80-5507-1652
send me an e-mail signifying Your decision including
your private Tel=2FFax numbers for quick
communication=2E


Respectfully submitted=2C
