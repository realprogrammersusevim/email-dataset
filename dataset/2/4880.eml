FROM THE DESK OF DR. USMAN BELLO
UNION BANK PLC
My name is Usman Bello the manager, credit and foreign bills of Union Bank =
Nigeria Plc. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with =
account number 14-255-2004/utb/t who perished in a plane crash Korean Air F=
light 801] with the whole passengers aboard on August 6,1998.
Since the demise of this client customer, I personally have watched with ke=
en interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one ha=
s come to claim his funds of USD$.30 m, [Thirty million United States dolla=
rs] which has been with my branch for a very long time. On this note, I dec=
ided to seek for a foreigner who I can present as the next of kin hence no =
one has come up to be the next of kin.
And the banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more Than fiv=
e years, after which the money will be called into the bank treasury as unc=
laimed funds after this period. In view of this I got your contact from a b=
usiness contact enquiry. Note that you do not need to have similar names wi=
th the late beneficiary. I will give you 25% of the total. Upon the receipt=
 of your response, I will commence on manipulating your information into th=
e file as the next of kin and I will send you information on how we intend =
to actualize our objective in a legal manner.
I will not fail to bring to your notice that this business is hitch free an=
d that you should not entertain any fear as all modalities for fund transfe=
r can be finalized within five banking days, after your claim is establishe=
d as the certified next of kin to
The deceased.=20
When you receive this letter. Kindly, send me your private Tel/Fax Numbers =
for quick communication through my private email box at dr_usmanbello20033@=
