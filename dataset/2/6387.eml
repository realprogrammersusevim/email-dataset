however notified to have the next of kin come and claim this money b'cos the 
money can only be released and paid to the next of kin to the deceased as 
indicated in the banking laws and guidlines,but several enquries i made 
inorder to get in contact with his possible relation revealed to me that his 
supposed relations were among those in the plane crash leaving nobody for 
the claim. 
The banking laws and guidlines here stipulates that if such account remains 
dormant for over 5yrs funds will be decleared as unclaimed and subsequently 
will be diverted into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds.In view to 
this,the bank have indicated action to divert this funds in question into 
the bank treasury within the next ( 21 ) official working days. 
I am only contacting you as a foreigner to assist claim and repatriate this 
money for safe keeping and for future investment before the funds is 
confisticated and diverted into the bank treasury as unclaimed funds.On this 
note,i seek your consent having contacted you to present and represent your 
interest here at the bank as the next of kin to enable the possible release 
and payment of this funds to you.I will be counting  on your reputation as 
being reliable and rightfull for this transaction.Positive measures to 
facilitate the success of this transaction have been arranged and will 
carefully be executed.This transaction is 100% risk free,so on gaining your 
interest in my proposed business relation to you then we can further discuss 
on the terms and modalities for sharing of the money. 
I anticipate your prompt response with your telephone numbers and best time 
to reach you. 
Understand that firstly an application has to be mailed to the bank and you 
are are to contact the bank so i require your full names and contact address 
to enable me address a formal application letter that will be used in 
filling claim for the release & payment of this funds to you as next of kin.

our selfs and also to benefit from it.Best regards,
