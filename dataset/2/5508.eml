Kindly accept my apology for sending my mail to you. I am a

true God fearing person, and I want you to trust me and

help me out in this my condition. I believe you are a

highly respected personality, considering the fact that I

sourced your profile from a human resource profile database

on your country in the Internet.



Though, I do not know to what extent you are familiar with

events and fragile political situation in Liberia but it

has formed consistent headlines in the CNN, BBC news

bulletins.



My Name is MRS.SUZANA NUHAN VAYE from Liberia, a Country in

West Africa. My late Husband is Issac Nuhan Vaye, Deputy

Minister of Public Works in Liberia. My Husband was falsely

accused of plotting to remove the then PRESIDENT OF LIBERIA

CHARLES TAYLOR) from office. Without trial, Charles Taylor

killed him. You can verify this from some of the

international newspapers posted in the web sites below:



(I)http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-07-15-liberia_x.htm



Before my husband was killed, he moved out the sum of $21.5

million through a diplomatic means, and deposited it with a

Security Company Abroad. And this money was meant for

importation of agricultural machinery.



All that is needed is for my lawyer to instruct the company

to transfer the funds to your account, I will remunerate

you with 20% at the end, but most of all is that I solicit

your trust and honesty in this transaction. I have been

confined only to our country home and all my calls are

monitored, so I will advise you to contact my private Attorney

Barr. P.O.Williams base in United Kingdom on his contact

stated below for onward proceedings: -

Numbers where you can always be reached, your Residential

information/documents that will enable you receive the fund

without any problem either now or in future as all

modalities as been perfected.
