FOR THE LOVE OF HUMANITY


Dear Friend,
Reply to:naybet@web-mail.com.ar

Your first reaction to this mail will be 
total rejection, scare and may be disbelief, 
owning largely to the atrocities people commit these days. 
 
But this mail comes from a devastated, 
sorrowful and emotional laden soul that needs 
compassion from a kind and good spirited person to wipe 
away my tears and appropriate my dream and humanitarian 
gesture.

As you read this, I don't want you to feel 
sorry for me, because, I believe everyone dies 
someday.My name is Naybet Trabelsi a merchant in 
Dubai,in the U.A.E.I worked with Zambian Ministry of 
Mining and Resources for eight years as a contractor,
I have been diagnosed with Esophageal 
cancer .

It has defiled all forms of medical 
treatment,I am very worried as the doctors have 
informed me that its terminal.
I don't know how much time I have left on 
earth, hence this mail to you.
I have not particularly lived my life  
well, as I never really cared for anyone but my
business. Though I am very rich, I was 
never generous, I was always hostile to people 
and only focused on my business as that was the only 
thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I 
now know that there is more to life than just 
wanting to have or make all the money in the world.
I believe when God gives me a second chance 
to come to this world I would live my life a 
different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has 
called me, I have willed and given most of my 
property and assets to my immediate and extended 
family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept 
my soul hence, I decided to give alms to charity
organizations, as I want this to be one of 
the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have 
distributed money to some charity organizations in the 
U.A.E,Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health 
has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this 
myself anymore. I once asked members of my family 
to close one of my accounts and distribute the money 
which I have there to charity organization in 
Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money 
to themselves. Hence, I do not trust them 
anymore, as they seem not to be content with what I 
have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of 
is the huge cash deposit of $18,000,000,00 that I 
have with a finance/Security Company 
abroad. I will want you to help me collect 
this deposit and dispatch it to charity 
organizations.

I have set aside 20% for you and for your 
time.

God be with you.
