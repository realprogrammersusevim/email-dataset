RE=3A   TRANSFER OF =5B$126=2C000=2E000=2E00 USD=5D 
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS=2E 

Hello=3A

I am Dr=2E Bello Kabir the General Auditor of highly
Capitalized Banks in West Africa=2E

I want to Transfer some Money into your account=2E This Money totalling
the
sum of USD$126Million =28One Hundred and Twenty Six Million Dollars=29=2C was
discovered when Auditing accounts in the Bank Of Commerce and Industry
also
known as the =22United Bank for Africa Plc =28Gabon=29=22=2E It was during the
process that I got to discover this Money held in one of the accounts
with
the Bank=2E 

My interest on this particular account started when I saw that the
account have
remained dormant since 1998=2C as nobody has operated on it since then=2E 
My Investigation also revealed to me that the Money belonged to a
Foreigner 
in Gabon=3A Mr=2E Alex C=2E Powell who was the Original owner of the Money and 
who died in 1998 without writing a =22WILL=22 therefore leaving nobody with 
any knowledge or trace of the Money=2E

This is therefore the reason why I have contacted you so that you will
act as 
the Beneficiary of the Money and receive it in your Bank account because
this money
can not be approved for Transfer to a local person here=2C without valid
international foreign passport=2C but can only be approved to any
foreigner with valid international passport or drivers license and
foreign Bank account because the money is in US dollars and the former
owner of
the account Mr=2E Alex C=2E Powell is a foreigner too=2C and the money can
only be
approved into a foreign Bank account=2E

We will start the first transfer with Twenty six million =5B$26=2C000=2E000=5D
upon successful Transfer without any disappoint from your side=2C we shall
re-apply for the payment of the remaining USD$100Million to your
account=2E 

I am revealing this to you with believe in God that you will never let
me down in this business=2C you are the first and the only person that I
am contacting for this business=2C so please reply urgently so that I will
inform you on the next step to take urgently=2E Send also the full details
of the Bank account to be used for the deposit=2E Also send me your
private telephone and Fax Numbers or easy and better Communication=2E

Be informed that at the Sucessful completion of the Transaction=2C 
I will give you 35% of the total Money=2E 60% will be my share of the  
Money while 5% will be dedicated to expenses incurred during the
Transaction=2E

I will hence be awaiting your reply in earnest as I look forward to a
very Sucessful Transaction with you=2E

Yours sincerely=2C
Dr=2E David Parblo
