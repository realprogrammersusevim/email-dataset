HIGH COURT REPRESENTATIVE
SUITE 202 OMEGA PLAZA, APAPA
LAGOS -NIGERIA.

Dear Sir/Ceo,

It is obvious that this proposal will come to you as a suprise. This is
because we have not met before but i am inspired to sending you thisemail by 
the huge fund transfer opportunity that will be of mutual benefit to the two 
of us.

However, I am Barrister Banco Eze,the personal Attorney to the late 
Engr.Steve Moore a national of Isle of Man in UK, who used to work with 
Shell Petroleum Development Company(SPDC) in Nigeria. On the 21st of April 
1996, my client,his wife And their three children were involved in a car 
accident along gamu/Lagos Express Road.

Unfortunately they all lost their lives in the event of the accident,
Since then I have made several enquiries to several Embassies to locate any 
of my clients extended relatives,this has also proved
unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts,I decided to trace 
his relatives over the Internet to locate any member of his family but of no 
avail, hence I contacted you.

I contacted you to assist in repartrating the money and property leftbehind 
by my client,I can easily convince the bank with my legal practice that you 
are the only surviving relation of my client. Otherwise the Estate he left 
behind will be confiscated or declared unserviceable by the bank where this 
huge deposits were lodged.

Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued atabout 
$27million U.S dollars(twenty seven million 
U.S.Americadollars).Conseqently,The bank issued me a notice to provide the 
next of kin or have the account confiscated within the next ten official 
working days.

since i have been unsuccesfull in locating the the relatives for overseveral 
years now.I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin of the 
deceased,so that the proceeds of this account valued at $27million 
U.Sdollars can be paid to your account and then you and me can share the 
money. 55%to me and 40% to you,while 5% should be for expenses or tax as 
your government may require.Your information such as below:

1.your full name

2.Resident Address

3.Telephone/Fax Numbers

Is required for immedaite commence of this transaction.

I have all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up anyclaim we 
may make. All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this 
deal through.

I guarantee that this will be executed under alegitimate arrangementthat 
will protect you from any breach of the law.Please get in touch with me by 
my email (barr_bancoeze55@walla.com) to enable us discuss further.

Yours Faithfully,
Barrister banco Eze(Esq)
