My Dear,

Greetings and l hope this message finds you well, and pardon me for 
contacting you this way , it is because of the urgent nature of my 
request.My name is Mrs. Mary Abavana and I am living with AIDS. Ever since 
my husband, Hon. Lawrence R. Abavana, former Ghanaian Agriculture minister 
died of AIDS and I was tested positive of the AIDS virus, the mass media 
wouldn't just let me and my family be. My children have stopped going to 
school because they could no longer stand the humiliations from fellow 
students. The embarrassment are getting on my nerves but what can I do? I 
would have loved to travel out of the country to a place where I will have 
peace and spend the rest of my life with my children but I couldn't make it 
for I am weak and severely sick. Moreover, no Embassy would grant me Visa to 
her country with my hairs withering and boils all over my body. View my 
family on the website:

>From all indications, I know that my days are numbered. In the light of the 
above, I have contacted you to assist me to accommodate the SUM OF $15 
Million USD and the 250kg of Gold which my husband acquired while alive and 
serving as minister and which he deposited as with a Finance and Gold 
company here in ghana for the up-keep of my children. I want you to 
safe-keep it for my children as they will be coming over to your country in 
due course to live and school. YOU WILL INVEST THIS MONEY FOR MY CHILDREN IN 
COMMERCIAL ESTATE OR ANY BUSINESS OF YOUR CHOICE YOU DEEM HEALTHY.

For your effort, I am prepared to give you 25% of the total funds. I am 
looking forward to hear from you while thanking you for your anticipated 
cooperation in this regard.Please l will need your telephone number also.

Kind Regards,
Mrs. Mary Abavana
