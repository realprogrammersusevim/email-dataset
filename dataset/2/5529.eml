My dearest,

With due regard and respect, I am emailing you although its wrong to seek
such assistance without prior knowledge of the person involved.  I hope I
am not mistaking but I also believe that at the end of the day, you will
never betray I and my family on this project.

I am Princess Fayad W. Bolkiah, the wife of Prince Jefri Bolkiah, former
Finance Minister of Brunei, the tiny oil-rich sultanate on the Gulf
Island. I did not mean to amplify my extended royal family history, which
has already been disseminated by the international media during the
controversial dispute that erupted between my husband and his stepbrother=
,
the sultan of Brunei; His Majesty Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzadin
Waddaulah.

As you may know from the international media, the sultan; His Majesty
Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Mu'izzadin Waddaulah had accused my husband of
financial mismanagement and impropriety of US$76.8 million dollars. This
was as a result of the Asian financial crisis that made my husband's
company Amedeo Development Company and government owned Brunei Investment
Company to be declared bankrupt during his tenure in office. However my
husband is in jail now, his bank accounts and private properties includin=
g
a crude oil export refinery have been confiscated by the sultanate.

Furthermore, during this unfortunate period I was advised to evacuate my
immediate family outside the sultanate to avoid further prosecution from
the sultan and his security operatives, but luck ran against me on my
attempt to escape. The Sultan now keeps me under house arrest and I have
no access to a phone but I have a Palm V hand-held computer from which I
am sending you this mail.

Before my In-castration, I was able to dispatch the sum of Fourteen
Million United States Dollars (US$14M) in cash under special arrangement
into the custody of a Private security and Trustee company for safe
keeping abroad. This action was on the orders of my husband to me to
enable us start a new life. The money was packaged carefully into two and
kept in trunks. Hence I seek your good assistance to retrieve this money
and further invest into profitable investment in your country to
facilitate future survival for my family abroad. I have decided to offer
20% of these funds to you as compensation for your strong cooperation.

Please I count on your absolute confidentiality, transparency and trust
while looking forward to your prompt reply towards a swift conclusion of
this business transaction.

Many Thanks & May Allah blessing remain with you, Amen.

I remain yours sincerely

Princess Fayad .W. Bolkiah
Brunei.
