My names is PRINCE DAVID MAPUKA, the elder son of Mr. ANTHONY MAPUKA,of Zimbabwe. It might be a surprise to you where I got your contact address, I got it from net work on line South African . During the current crises against  the farmers of Zimbabwe by the supporters of our President Robert Mugabe to  claim all the white owned farms in our country, he ordered all the white  farmers to surrender their farms to his party members and their followers. 

My father was one of the best farmers in the country and knowing that he did not support the presidents political ideology, the presidents supporters invaded my fathers farm burnt down everything, shot him and 
as a result of the wounds sustained, he became sick and died after two days.  And after his death, I with my younger Brother decided to move out of Zimbabwe for the safety of our lives to South-Africa. 

BUT, before he died HE WROTE HIS WILL, which reads "(MY BELOVEED SON ,I WISH TO DRAW YOUR ATTENTION TO THE SUM OF ($21,000,000).TWENTY ONE MILLION U.S DOLLARS WHICH I DEPOSITED IN A BOX WITH A SECURITY COMPANY INJOHANNESBURG (SOUTH-AFRICA). IN CASE OF MY ABSENCE ON EARTH CAUSED BY DEATH ONLY". You

money out of South Africa for investment purpose.
