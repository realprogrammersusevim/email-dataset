Dear Sir=2C

I am Mr=2E Michael Frein=2C I work with a finance company here in the United Kingdom=2EOur company is a frontline finance house with clients all over the World=2E We are an independent financial institution with most secure operation in keeping financial deposits from any sort of fraud=2C theft or laundering investigation=2E Our regulated position has attracted all manner of clientele to our organisation including heads of various governments=2C top-level executives=2Cetc=2E

One of our clients=2C DR=2E ROBERT DIMITRIS=2C who was before his death=2C was an adviser to the Organisation of Petroleum Export Country =28OPEC=29=2C had over fifty Million pounds lodged with us=2E On his death five years ago=2C his heir =28his wife=29 put a claim for his money and my company paid off in line with her request=2E However=2Chis wife did not know that the facts of Nine million=2C eight hundred thousand British Pounds =28GBP3=2E8 Million=29paid in by DR=2EROBERT DIMITRIS in a different account and the money is still lying with us=2E

I therefore made further investigations and discovered that DR=2E ROBERT DIMITRIS did not declare any kin or relations in all his official documents=2C including his Bank deposit paperwork in my Financial Institution=2EThis sum of GBP3=2E8 million is still in my Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year=2E No one has and will ever come forward to claim it=2E According to British law=2C at the expiration of 7 =28seven=29 years=2C the money will revert to the ownership of the British Government if nobody applies to claim the funds=2E Based on my position in this company=2C I have kept the facts of this case and a few others I am
still watching closely to myself alone=2EThe reason I have decided to contact you is because I am quite certain I can move these funds out immediately but would need your assistance=2E

What this requires is that you put in an application with a letter of probate=2C which I will forward to you=2E This will enable us to open a premium account with my Financial Institution and I will simply make an internal database transfer of the Funds to your account=2E Once this is done and you will see your new balance=2C you will put in a claim to have your money=2EHowever=2C due to the fact that my company would not entertain your request to open an account without a proof of the fund origin=2C 

I have without divulging secured the copy of the deposit document of the said fund and will forward it to you when I have your interest in my proposal=2E On grounds that you agree to do this with me=2C the money will be shared in the ratio of 60% for me and 40% for you=2E However=2C it is quite necessary that these are kept as confidential as possible for its successive completion within days=2E Please contact me and I will take it from there=2E Once I hear from you=2CI will give you access to view DR=2EROBERT DIMITRIS account details and you can check
his account statement via the bank s online services to certify what am saying=2E

Please reply through my email address or I will be expecting your reply=2E

Sincerely=2C

Mr=2E Michael
