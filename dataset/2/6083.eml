Dear friend,

Thanks for your concern to my proposal. I am Mr Mark 
Hernandez the linkman between the Organization For Petroleum Exporting 
Countries - OPEC and World Bank. I also attend OPEC meetings 
constantly 
in Geneva Switzerland on the auspices of World Bank.

Through the sale 
of our allocated oil quota in OPEC, I was able to 
makeS$22.2million, 
which is currently deposited in a Security firm 
abroad. I want you to 
assist me to claim this money as I cannot claim 
it directly because i 
am still a Civil servant in active service, and 
the code of conduct 
bureau forbids me to acquire such huge amount of 
money.

It is on this 
basis that I am contacting you for assistance, 
If You will be 
interested, and all claim documents will be processed, 
and sent to you. 
The documents with which the fund is deposited will 
be changed to 
reflect you as the new beneficiary so that you will be 
eligible to 
collect the fund on my behalf.

I will give you 30% of the 
fund for 
this assistance, while 60% will be for me and 10% will be for 
expenses 
that may be incurred on both sides. I am aware of the 
international 
monitoring of all large-scale financial movements after 
the September 
11th 2001 Terrorist attack on America (USA) and to avoid 
any state of 
financial Investigation I will provide a classified 
clearance paper 
from the relevant body, which will exonerate the money 
from drug, money 
laundered or terrorist related funds.

Kindly respond 
to my proposal 
through this my private email on the receipt of your 
mail indicating 
interest. I want to assure you that this is 100% risk 
free. I will give 
you more details concerning this as soon as I 
received your swift 
response which must include your full names, 
address, occupation, age 
phone and fax number. 

Expecting your 
response. 

Yours sincerely,

Mr Mark Hernandez.
