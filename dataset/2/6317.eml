Dear Sir,

Difficulties encountered in efforts to establish a business abroad necessitate this search for someone to assist me in securing and investing the sum of USD22,000.000 (twenty two million dollars)inherited from my father's business reserve.

I am the heir of a Zimbabwean family.my father was an agriculturist. He became rich from his old-aged investment in agriculture and later was victimized by President Robert Mugabe's land reform policy. He was assassinated by unknown gunmen for defending his land ownership and siding the minority white farmers. Before his death, my father foresaw the insecurity of both our lives and property and decided to deposit the above sum with a private finance and security firm in Europe. This money has become the only inherited property of our family since our home was burnt and the farmlands and machines seized;yet the government and it's loyalists are bent on making life difficult for us.

To summarise this traumatic story, my mother and I have decided to offer 25% of the above sum to anyone who assists us to secure this funds overseas or 35% share for possible help on investing in any reliable venture.

if you would want to proceed under these terms,please reply for detailed information. if you do not accept my offer, in good fate treat with utmost confidentiality . A quick reply with your name,telephone and fax numbers for more confidential communication will be highly appreciated.

Sincerely yours,

DANDLA NGUBE
