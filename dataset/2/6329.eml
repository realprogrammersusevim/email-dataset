FROM: Mr. Mark Andreas

  Johannesburg, South Africa.

  Dear Sir / Madam,
I am Mark Andreas,  the son of comrade Border Andreas who was the former =
Zimbabwean Minister for youth, gender and Employment creation. While aliv=
e, my father stood against seizure of white farms and it's distribution  =
to the blacks without compensation to the white owners.
=20
First and foremost, I apologized using this medium to reach you for a tra=
nsaction / business of this magnitude, but this is due to Confidentiality=
 and prompt access reposed on this medium. In unfolding this proposal, I =
want to count on you, as a respected and honest person to handle this tra=
nsaction with sincerity, trust and confidentiality. I have decided to see=
k a confidential co-operation with you in the execution of the transactio=
n described hereunder for the benefit of all parties involved and hope yo=
u will keep it as a top secret because of the nature of this transaction.
=20
Because of what is happening in the world today and to verify my predicam=
ents as well as my sincerity, I would like you to visit the site below to=
 read more about my father.

Because of my father=92s sincerity, he was killed by a planned motor acci=
dent along Harare-Masvingo Road near Mvuma Province of Zimbabwe. But befo=
re his untimely death, my father told me some few weeks earlier that he k=
ept a box with a private Security and finance Company in Johannesburg, So=
uth Africa which contains US$20.5 Million (Twenty million, five hundred t=
housand United States dollars). He warned that he only declared the conte=
nts of the box to the Security and finance Company as family treasure/ va=
luables, with insurance values of the said amount. He also told me that h=
e used my name as the beneficiary of this money being his first child.
=20
The original document that shows the Deed of lodge, Proof of Deposit, and=
 Depository Agreement between my late father and the Management of the Se=
curity Company was kept with my mother.
=20
After my father=92s death, mother, my little sister and I ran to South Af=
rica to seek asylum for our lives. Because of the South African financial=
 law which prohibits asylum seekers/refugees like my mother and I to open=
 bank account or involve in any financial transaction, I decided to write=
 to you to seek your assistance for this money to be transferred into you=
r company=92s or personal bank account while all arrangement for a hitch =
free transfer have been fully taken care of.
I have the authority of my family to propose that should you be willing t=
o assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will be US$5.1=
25m (25%), while my family takes US$13.325m (65%) and the balance of US$2=
.5m (10%) for miscellaneous expenses that may be incurred by either party=
 during the transfer.
=20
I want to let you know that this transaction is 100% risk free provided y=
ou treat it with utmost confidentiality because the Zimbabwean Government=
 are bent on collecting  all assets / properties belonging to my late fat=
her.
=20
Please, I do hope that this money will be safe when finally transferred i=
nto your account and I do hope of establishing a good relationship with y=
ou and your family after this transaction. I wait to hear from you.
=20
Regards & God bless,
Mr. Mark Andreas
(For and on behalf of my family)
