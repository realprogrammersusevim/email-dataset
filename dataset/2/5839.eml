Mr. James Nicholas
Calabar, 

Dear Prospective Business Partner,

I am e-mailing to you this business proposition having gone through your =
remarkable profile on the internet. Though, this medium (Internet) has been =
greatly abused, I choose to reach you through it because it still remains the =
fastest, surest and most secured means for me to communicate with you at this =
time.

However, this correspondence is unofficial and private, and it should be =
treated as such. Official telephone calls and fax messages to me WILL NOT be =
entertained for security reasons and for the success of this project. For =
further briefing, you can reach me only via my private email address as =
stated below or through my lawyer whose contact shall be provided to you
in due cause.

My name is Mr. James Nicholas. I am the chief financial controller to Mr. =
Charles Taylor, the ex-president of Liberia who is presently on exile in =
Nigeria.  As his private financial controller, I have access to his financial =
records more than any of his family members.

Mr Charles Taylor has over $1 billion dollars outside Liberia and his family =
members or people around him are not aware of this. With his present notion =
of arrest and following his restricted movement and the recent proclamation =
by Zurich authority, the U.N war crimes court and the America Government, has =
agreed that all Bank account belonging to Charles Taylor should be reported =
and freezed. 

Therefore I want to use this opportunity to make good money for myself. I =
have worked for him for over 10 years and I have nothing to show for it. I am =
only leaving on his empty promises and hopes.

Presently, I have complete information to authorize with documents for =
collecting /receiving $200 million from one of his financial sources in South =
Africa. And I need your assistance in receiving the funds in Europe on my =
behalf. Charles Taylor has prepared himself legally and secretly arranged =
with Top most Government agents to transfer the funds upon instructions.

In light of the above, I am seeking your cooperation to act as the authorized =
beneficiary of the said funds to enable us claim the funds for our mutual =
benefit. As you probably already aware, Mr. Charles Taylor maybe handed over =
by his host country to the new Liberia Government to face trial soon hence =
the need for urgent attention to this matter. 

Your prompt responce to my proposal will be highly appreciated. As soon as I =
receive your geniue intention to cooperate with me, I will have my lawyer =
provide you with the necessary details as required to enable us conclude this =
transaction successfully. I thank you and look forward to hearing from you =
shortly.

Regards

James Nicholas
please reply via my private e-mail below.

..........................................

Because of charles Taylors notion of arrest, and with the present development =
the security alert-ness is higher, so I will introduced my lawyer to you upon =
your responce to my proposal.
