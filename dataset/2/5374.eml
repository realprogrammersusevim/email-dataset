I seriously need your kind assistance and co-operations=2E  Few weeks before my husband's death=2C 
he entrusted the cash sum of $85 million U=2ES dollars to my care for safe keeping in my apartment=2E

Now I solicit your assistance to accept this sum for self-keeping=2E This I cannot lodge into a 
local bank account to avoid suspicion from the Government=2C my husband's brother's and wife 
since they have Confiscated all that is left by my husband and still places eyes on me if they

give this a quick and urgent attention while I expect your response for more briefing from me=2C

contact of any of your trusted close confidant you feel can keep this confidential and capable of
handling such because of his level of knowledge in investment and cash flow in business=2E 
Remember the confidentiality=2C as this is not for any third party=2C hence this should remain
