Mr.Eric Wong.
99 Queens Road,
Central London
UK,

Hello,

I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this letter as a
desperate search for assistance in a matter that shall benefit both of us=
.

A random search based on your locality from the Internet produced your
address, Please i apologise for this medium of contact as it appears the
only definate way i can have assistance with this matter.

I am Mr Eric Wong,Former Head of Private Banking, Union Bank Of
China,Presently based in London, United Kingdom.Also account Manager to a
deceased Immigrant property magnate who was based in the U.K, and had vas=
t
business interest in Hong Kong and and China ,also referred to as my
client.

On Monday, 31 July, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK , my client, his wife and
their two Children died in the Air France concord plane crash bound for
New York in their plan for a world cruise

I have been managing his  Bank accounts in Hong Kong, and some Properties
which he had put out for sale. The properties which have long been put ou=
t
on sale have been paid for, and the money paid has long been deposited
into his local bank account here. I have contacted you to assist in
repatriating the money and estate left behind by my client before they ge=
t
confiscated or declared unserviceable by my Former Bank. Particularly, th=
e
bank has issued me with a notice to provide any of his next of kin or hav=
e
the account confiscated within a short period of time.My late client has
an account is valued at 18 Million United States Dollars Only

I therefore made further investigation,with the personel department and
discovered that did not declare any kin or relations in all his official
documents, including his Bank Deposit paperwork in my Bank. This sum of
US$18million is still sitting in my Former Bank and the interest is being
rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year. No one will
ever come forward to claim it. According  to Laws of Hong Kong, at the
expiration of 5 (five) years, the money will revert to the ownership of
the Hong Kong Government if nobody applies to claim the fund.

I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to my deceased
client, so that the proceeds of his account valued at 18 Million United
States Dollars Only can be paid to you,I will like you to provide
immediately your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare
the necessary documents and affidavits that will put you in place as the
next of kin.

The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me
and 35% for you and 5%, after completion,for Expenses Incurred in the
course of the transaction .There is no risk at all as all the paperwork
for this transaction will be done by the attorney and withmy position as
the Head Private Banking guarantees the successful execution of this
transaction. If you are interested, please reply immediately to my email:
erickw115@yahoo.com.hk

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see this deal
through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. Trust me as
his Manager of his Estates, as i have all the needed information, that
this is a risk-free relationship.You should observe utmost
confidentiality, and rest assured that this transaction would be most
profitable for both of us because I shall  require your assistance to
invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply.
