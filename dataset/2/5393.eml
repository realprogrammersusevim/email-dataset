I am Tom Adams, the family lawyer to late General Sani Abacha, the 
eldest son of the late president of Nigeria, General Sani Abacha. He 
was falsely accused of murder and as such was imprisoned, but thanks to 
God, he has been released for his innocence, presently he is under 
house arrest. 
Well dear friend we need your assistance in transferring some of his 
money into your account that are with a security firm abroad whose name 
is withheld for security reason, until you open communication with me 
because the government is making plans to seize them, as they did to 
his father's own. 

Please view this site and read its content carefully,

The amount is $10.6 million in a Security firm abroad. All that is 
needed is for me to instruct the company to release the funds to you 
for safe keeping.

your assistance; Five percent (5%) would be set aside to take care of 
all expenses we may incur during the transaction.
