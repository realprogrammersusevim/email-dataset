Dear Sir,

Re: FIRST TRANSFER OF $6M [Six million] US DOLLAR

I am jubeeg venture, the operational manager in account management section =
incharge of credit and foreign bills of one of the prime banks here in Sout=
h Africa. I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank who peri=
shed with his whole families on
25TH JULY,2000 CONCORDE PLANE CRASH [ Flight AF4590 ] with the whole passen=
gers aboard.=20

There is an account opened in this bank in 1998 by this great late INDUSTRI=
ALIST who died without a written or oral WILL attatched to the account. Sin=
ce his death , I personally has watched with keen interest to see the next =
of kin but all has proved abortive as no one has come to claim his funds an=
d no other person knows about this account or anything concerning it,the ac=
count has no other beneficiary and until his death he was the manager of hi=
s company.

The total amount involved is 106,000,000.00 USD.[ One hundred and six milli=
on United States Dollar ]. We wish to start the first transfer with $6,000,=
000.00
[Six million] and upon successful transaction without any disappointment fr=
om your side, we shall re-apply for the transfer of the remaining balance t=
o your account.

I have secretly discussed this matter with the general manager of the bank =
who I must involve in order to have a smooth and a successful transfer of t=
he fund to any foreign bank account which you are going to nominate. On thi=
s note, I decided to seek for a reliable foreigner who will act as the fore=
ign beneficiary of the fund from the deceased by providing
his/her bank account where the fund will be transferred for immediate inves=
tment on any viable project as no one has come up to be the next of kin.

The banking ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than six yea=
rs without claim hence the money will be recalled to the government treasur=
y as unclaimed after this long period of domancy.=20

In view of this I got your contact through my personal search to see if you=
 can assist by providing your safe bank account for the transfer or find a =
reliable person who will be capable of receiving such amount in his or her =
personal account.At the conclussion of the
transfer 65% of the fund will be for me, I will give you 20% of the total t=
ransfer sum, 10% for charity both in Africa and in your country while the r=
emaining 5% will be set aside to settle expenses both parties might incure =
during the transfer process.

Upon the receipt of your reply, I will send to you a detailed information a=
bout the transaction. I will not fail to bring to your notice that this bus=
iness is 100% risk and trouble free and that you should not entertain any f=
ear as all modalities for fund transfer
can be finalized within 7 to 9 banking days, after you apply to the bank as=
 the beneficiary of the fund from the deceased.=20

When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail or you can call me o=
r fax me VIA:=20
TEL:870} 763 648313, {870} 763 648314,
FAX:(870} 763 648315. You should also include
your private fax and phone numbers for easy and safe communication.
