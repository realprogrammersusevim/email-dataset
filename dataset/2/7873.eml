FROM THE DESK OF
BARRISTER AKANDE FREDRICK
NIKK PLAZA 5th FLOOR FLAT 4
AWOLOWO WAY IKEJA LAGOS NIGERIA

Dear ,

I am Barrister AKANDE FREDRICK, a solicitor at law. I am the personal attorney
to Mr. Alfred, a national of your country, who used to work with Eagle Cement
in Nigeria. Here in after Eagle Cement be referred to as my client. On the
21st of April 2001, my client, his wife and their only daughter were involved
in a car accident along sagbama express road.All occupants of the vehicle
unfortunately lost there lives. Since then I have made several enquiries
to your embassy here to locate any of my clients extended relatives,

this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts,
I decided to track his last name over the Internet, to locate any member
of his family hence I contacted you. I have contacted you to assist in repartrating
the fund valued at US$13 million left behind by my client before it gets
Confisicated or declaredunserviceable by the Security Finance Firm where
this huge amount weredeposited. The said Security Finance company has issued
me a notice to provide the next of kin or have the account confisicated
within the next fourteen official working days. For the fact that I have
been unsuccesfull in locating the relatives for over 2 years now, I seek
the consent to present you as the next of kin to the deceased,since you
have the same last name with my client, so that the proceeds of this account
can be paid to you. Therefore, on receipt of your positive response, we
shall then discuss the sharing ratio and modalities for transfer.

I have all necessary information and legal documents needed to back you
up for claim. All I require from you is your honest cooperation to enable
us see this transaction through. I guarantee that this will be executed
under legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the
law. 
Best Regards,
BARRISTER
AKANDE FREDRICK(Esq).
