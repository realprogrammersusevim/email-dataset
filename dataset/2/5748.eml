"How to turn =A33 into =A310,000"=20
This is not a get rich quick scheme, but with a little effort will make a=
 nice little return - perhaps pay off that credit card after the Xmas spe=
nd, or pay for that much needed holiday

Please take the time to read the following information, which I received =
recently.
=20
Please try not to be sceptical about this program and at least think abou=
t it for a few days, otherwise you could be throwing away over =A310,000 =
in cash! This system has worked for 2 years and the thousands of people, =
who joined, have been amazed by the results of giving a little time and j=
ust =A33.00 (=805/$5.00).

In March of 2003, I received a short and simple e-mail telling me how to =
make over =A310,000 at a time. Of course I ignored it, but I didn't delet=
e the mail, as there was something about it which rang true and I was kee=
n to know if it was possible to make that amount of money in such a short=
 space of time. I was at that time getting deep in debt. I finally realiz=
ed that I had absolutely nothing to lose by having a go at the plan offer=
ed to me in that email. And apart from that, I just couldn't stop myself =
from thinking "What if it actually works?" For the sake of =A33 isn't it =
worth a go!
I put my doubts to one side, went ahead and followed the simple instructi=
ons given in that email. It took me less than 30 minutes to complete and =
it cost me no more than =A33 (=805/$5).=20

What did it say in that email? Well, if you'll read on, all will be revea=
led!=20
The business plan I am about to share with you works perfectly every sing=
le time. I've never made less than =A310,000 from it on each occasion. Le=
t me assure you that this is a LEGITIMATE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY, a perfect=
ly legal moneymaking enterprise. It does not require you to sell anything=
. It does not require you to speak to your friends, family or anybody els=
e (unless you want to).=20
This must sound like an outrageous claim, particularly if you've never ha=
d possession of this sort of money before, but believe me, this business =
works like nothing else you may have seen before in your life! By followi=
ng the simple 3-step plan set out below, within a few short weeks your li=
fe could be transformed beyond all recognition!=20

Please do not allow your initial scepticism to deprive you of financial s=
uccess.=20

This program is by no means new. It has been in existence in many forms f=
or at least a decade. But in the early days, it required a lot more time =
and effort, as well as an outlay of a few hundred pounds. However, thanks=
 to PayPal and the Internet, the outlay is now virtually ZERO! And what's=
 more, the entire process is FASTER, EASIER, and MORE LUCRATIVE than it h=
as EVER been!=20
This program works no matter what country you are in, or what currency yo=
u use. It doesn't matter how old or how young you are. And you certainly =
won't need any special knowledge or talent. You won't need to run a websi=
te, or make phone calls, or make photocopies, or send out letters through=
 the mail, or pay for advertising, etc.=20

You will need:
=B7	An email address=20
=B7	A Premier or Business PayPal account with at least =A33 (=805/$5) dep=
osited in it=20
=B7	30 minutes of your time=20

PayPal is the simplest method of sending and receiving payments online th=
at anyone has ever seen! Once you have a PayPal account, you can send and=
 receive credit card payments to or from anyone - anywhere in the world! =
However, please read further before you visit their website.=20

To get started, follow the instructions exactly as set out below and then=
 prepare yourself for an influx of cash over the next 30 days!=20

Here's what you need to do:
STEP 1: If you're not already a PayPal user, the very first thing you nee=
d to do is click on the PayPal link below and SIGN UP. It takes just 2 mi=
nutes.
http:/www.paypal.com=20
=20
STEP 2: When you have opened your account, send a =A33 (=805/$5) payment =
from your PayPal account to the FIRST email address in the list below, al=
ong with a note saying:=20
" Please add me to your mailing list. "=20
Be certain to add this note, as this is what KEEPS THIS PROGRAM LEGAL. In=
structions on how to send a payment are under "SEND MONEY" at the PayPal =
site. It's that easy!!=20
Here's the current list:=20

1.	hurst_l@lineone.net
2.	admin@makinscentz.com
3.	tracy@chezmoi79.freeserve.co.uk
4.	charlotte2012@hotmail.co.uk
5.	kingsley.enterprise@tiscali.co.uk



STEP 3: Once you've sent a =A33 (=805/$5) payment to the address at the t=
op of the list (along with your note - this is VERY important!), the next=
 thing to do is copy the contents of this page, as you'll be sending it o=
ut (as an email message) to at least 40 people, although with the legitim=
ate mailing lists and the different ways of advertising on the internet, =
e.g. Ebay, the amount of recipients of your mail could well exceed into t=
he hundreds, thousands or even millions if you wish. The more people who =
join in, the more profitable for everyone on the list. If you are going t=
o use a mailing list, please make sure it is from a reputable source and =
includes people who have "Opted In". These lists contain names of people =
who have no objections to receiving these types of mails.=20

The e-mail that you will send out will contain a copy of this document in=
 your new email message. (You can edit and format the message text in any=
 way you want! However, it's best to just leave the text as it is because=
 you want your email to be read by everyone who receives it).

Delete the e-mail address at No 1 in the list and move the others up one =
place (2 becomes 1, 3 becomes 2 etc)
No 5 in the list will be empty, so put YOUR address in this space. (This =
is the e-mail address you used to sign up to PayPal), your email is now r=
eady for sending!=20
A word of warning! Don't be tempted to add your email address to position=
 1 in order to earn money fast! It doesn't work like that! If you do that=
, you will ONLY reach the people you directly send emails to, and then yo=
ur address will be immediately removed from the No 1 place and you won't =
reach any more people! However, if you add your name to the No 5 position=
, there will be literally tens of thousands of people receiving and sendi=
ng e-mail's later - when your name has reached the No 1spot!!!=20

When you send out your e-mails, your address will initially be at No 5 in=
 the list. The response-rate for this program is much higher than any typ=
ical email marketing campaign for a number of reasons, which are explaine=
d later.=20
As long as you send your e-mails to people who are likely to be intereste=
d in this program, you can expect an average response from about 25% of t=
he people you send to. Let's be conservative here and assume that you rec=
eive only an average response rate of 12.5%.=20
If you send out your email to 40 different people, you can expect at leas=
t 5 of those people to do exactly what you did (12.5% of 40 =3D 5). By th=
is time, your email address will have moved up to No 4 in the list, and t=
his list will now have reached around 200 people (5 x 40).=20
Out of those 200 people, you can expect at least 25 of them to participat=
e (12.5% of 200 =3D 25), so that's a further 1,000 emails (25 x 40) being=
 sent out and your email address will have risen to No 3 in the list.=20
Out of those 1,000 people, you can expect at least 125 of them to partici=
pate (12.5% of 1,000 =3D 125), so that's a further 5,000 emails (125 x 40=
) being sent out with you now at the No 2 position.=20
Out of those 5,000 people, you can expect at least 625 of them to respond=
 (12.5% of 5,000 =3D 625), so that's 25,000 emails (625 x 40) being sent =
out with YOUR ADDRESS at the No 1 spot!=20
Now, out of those 25,000 people, you can expect around 3,125 of them to r=
espond (12.5% of 25,000 =3D 3,125). And since you will now be at No 1 in =
the list, you will receive =A33 (=805/$5) from each of them, that's; =A39=
,375 (3,125 x =A33(=805/$5).
=20
So, when your name starts to hit the No 1 position within the next few da=
ys, it will be YOUR turn to collect the money! Over the course of 30 days=
 the money will be sent to you, by a few thousand people just like yourse=
lf. The first payments will arrive within a few days, and they will conti=
nue at the rate of about 100 payments per day for about 30 days. After th=
at time, the volume of payments begins to taper off as your e-mail addres=
s vacates the No 1 position.=20
