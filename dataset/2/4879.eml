LADY MARYAM ABACHA 
ABACHA COURT 
GIDADO ROAD 
KANO - NIGERIA 

ATTENTION:C.E.O 

I am lady Maryam Abacha, wife of the late General Sani 
Abacha,ex-military Head of State of the Federal Republic of Nigeria who 
died on the 8th of June 1998 of heart problems.

I contacted you because of my need to deal with person/persons who my 
family and I have had no previous personal relationship with. 

An adventist friend of the family introduced you to me. Since the death 
of my husband, my family had been subjected to all sorts of harrassment 
and intimidation with lots of negative reports emanating from the 
government and the press about my husband. 

The present Government has also ensured that our bank accounts are 
frozen and all assests siezed. 

It is in view of this that I seek your co-operation and assistance in 
the transfer of the sum of US$100Million only being the very last of my 
family fund in my possession and control. 

The Federal Government have seized all our properties and frozen all 
our accounts both local and international, but my only hope now is the 
available US$100Million cash, which I carefully packaged and deposited 
with a security finance company in Holland.

My purpose of contacting you is for someone who will be able to pay the dumurrage charges incured in the security finance company and also after transfering the 
funds, will be able to invest the funds on my behalf till such a time 
when I will be free from my present predicament.


Your benefit I can assure you will be very substantial. 

Please ensure to keep this proposal very secret and confidential for 
obvious reasons and send to us your private telephone and fax numbers for 
easy and confidential communication. 

We await your immediate response. 

Sincerely yours, 

LADY MARYAM ABACHA
