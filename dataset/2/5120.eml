the personal attorney to Late Mr. Samy Makary a National of finland, who used to be a private contractor 
with the Halliburton Company in Saudi Arabia, herein after shall be referred to as my client. 
Upon Maturity, we sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply. After a month, we 
sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers (Gardiner & Theobald) that Mr 
Samy Makary was aboard the EgyptAir Flight 990, which crashed into the Atlantic Ocean on October 31 
1999 (http://www.greatdreams.com/PassEAir990.htm).
Since then, I have made several enquiries with his country's embassies to locate any of my clients 
extended relatives, this has also proved unsuccessful. After these several unsuccessful attempts, I 
decided to contact you with this business partnership proposal. I have contacted you to assist in 
repatriating a huge amount of money left behind by my Client before they get confiscated or declared 
unserviceable by the Bank where this huge deposit was lodged.

Pounds) and the Bank has issued me a notice to provide his next of kin or Beneficiary by Will otherwise 
have the account confiscated within the next thirty official working days. Since I have been 
unsuccessful in locating the relatives for over three years now, I seek your consent to present you as the 
next of kin / Will Beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at 
8.5Million(Eight Million Five hundred thousand Pounds) can be paid to you. This will be disbursed or 
shared in these percentages, sixty percentage to me and fourty precentage to you. I have all necessary 
legal documents that can be used to Back up any claim will be obtained From the Court of England with 
the Certificate Of Deposit which has been issued to me by the Bank. All I require is your honest 
Co-operation, Confidentiality and Trust to enable us see this project through.I guarantee you that this will 
be executed under a legitimate Arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law. All the 
relevant documents that will give you the legal backing to claim the fund will be processed.Please

me the following below; this is to enable me commence immediate preparation of all legal document that 
will back up our claim.
