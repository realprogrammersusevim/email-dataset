ATTN:
Dear Sir,
I am a Barrister and a member of Nigeria Bar
Association (NBA). Your contact reached me through the
World Business Encyclopaedia and my insistence on you.
Hence, I made up my mind to introduce this business to
you in confidence for the mutual benefit of both of
us. The sum of USD75M (Seventy Five Million United
States Dollars) was lodged into one of the leading
private Banks here in the Country by the late Head of
State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) this money was lodged in a
DEFACED FORM and in vaults / boxes.
The money was originally meant to be used for his
political campaign. Because I was his family Attorney
as such he confided in me with the relevant document
papers relating to this Bank died of cardiac arrest.
As a matter of fact, I have adequately agreed with
some of the key officers of the private Bank to
negotiate with you a trustworthy person to provide an
account where this money could be transferred to your
country through your Bank account, because we cannot
claim the money here in Nigeria. We have concluded all
arrangement with an offshore Security Company to move
this money through diplomatic means a country where it
could be directly transferred to your nominated
account to ensure absolute safety and risk-free
transfer of the money. After a successful transfer,
30% will be for you for your assistance, 5% for
general expenses, and 65% for us. You are required to
send by e-mail immediately your Telephone and Fax
numbers and Bank particulars where this money will be
lodged and your personal contact address. Once you
notify me your willingness by sending the above
requirement. This transaction will be concluded within10 (ten) working da=
ys.
I will be waiting for your urgent reply.
Best regards,

Bar marcel remmy {san}
