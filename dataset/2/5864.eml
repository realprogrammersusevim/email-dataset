Dear Friend,

    Compliments of the day, I hope that this letter will not constitute a sort
of embarrasement to you. Please bear with me let me introduce myself. I am
Barrister Tony Abbas, the attorney to Late Engr Alex, a National of your
country, who owned a metal producing factory (Metalco Enterprise) in Nigeria
and a personal friend died and left behind his deposit in a finance house
(GLOBAL SECURITIES & FINANCE COMPANY) valued at $14.5Millon (Fourteen Million
Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only).

    My relationship with Engr.Alex started in 1999 when I was working
with the security company as a Legal Adviser, Marina branch. We met in my social
club's annual end of the year party and I introduced him to the said security
company where he deposit most of his treasures some few weeks later,making me
the Legal officer to the account which he operated until his unfortunate
demise.On the 31st of March 2001, Engr.Alex, his wife and their two children
were involved in a car accident. All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately
lost their lives.
    After the incident i contacted Engr.Alex sister (Ms Martha Stevens)
which was his beneficiary/next of kin but unfortunately before she
could claim his estate she too died in September 11, 2001 terrorist
attack at the world trade center in the United State Of America. See
http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2001/memorial/lists/by-name/page95.html

    Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of Engr.Alex
extended relatives this has also proved unsuccessful. After these
several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to track his last name over
the Internet, to locate any member of his family or anyone related to him hence
I contacted you . Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for
over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the
deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued at US$14.500,000 (Fourteen
Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars Only) can be paid to you and
then you and I can sharethe money.70% to me and 30% to you.The request of a
foreigner as next of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that My
client was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot stand as a next of kin to a
foreigner.

    I am ready to re-negotiate the mode of sharing with you.Thereafter I will
visit your country for the disbursement/investing of my share according to the
percentages we agreed upon.If you find this proposal suitable for you do get
back to me with the following informations Your full Name and Contact
Address,Your private telephone Number Your Age Your Occupation and Position.

    All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this deal
through.I guarantee that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please for the sake of
confidentiality send your reply to my private email :
abbaschambers@abbaschambers.org or call +234-805-823-3576.

Hoping to receive a positive response from you.

Best regards,

Barrister Tony Abbas.
