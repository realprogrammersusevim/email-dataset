Hello Dear =2C 
I am EL=2EGaily Maliky=2E
The Bank Manager of PACIFIC BANK PLC DAKAR-SENEGAL=2CBranch=2E I have urgent and very confidential business proposition for you=2E 
On June 6 2000=2C a Chinese oil consultant =2F contractor with the SENEGALIS National Petroleum Corporation=2C 
Mr=2E Chung Wyi made a numbered time =28Fixed=29 deposited for twelve calendar months=2C valued at US$13=2C000=2C000=2E00 =28thirteen Million Dollars=29in my branch=2E 
Upon maturity=2C I sent a routine notification to his forwarding address but got no reply=2E 
After a month=2C we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his contract employers=2C SENEGALIS National Petroleum Corporation that Mr=2E Chung Wyi died from an automobile accident=2E On further investigation=2C
I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless=2E 
I therefore made further investigation and discovered that Mr=2E Chung Wyi did not declare any next of kin in all his official documents=2C including his Bank Deposit paperwork=2E This sum of US$13=2C000=2C000=2E00 is still sitting in the Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year=2E 
No one will come forward to claim it=2E According to our Law=2C at the expiration of 5 =28five=29 years=2C the money will revert to the ownership of the SENEGAL Government if nobody applies to claim the funds=2E 
Consequently=2C my proposal is that I will like you as a foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr=2E Chung Wyi so that the fruits of this old man's labor will not get into the hands of some corrupt officials=2E 
This is simple=2C 
I will like you to provide me immediately with your full names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits=2C which will put you in place as the next of kin=2E 
We shall employ the services of two attorneys for drafting and notarization of the WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate =2F administration in your favor for the transfer=2E 

A bank account in any part of the world=2C which you provide=2C will then facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary =2F next of kin=2E 
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60% for me and 30% for you and then the remaining 10 will be maped out for any expences done before or after the transfer=2E 

As all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the attorney and my position as the Branch Manager guarantees the successful execution of this transaction=2E 
If you are interested=2C please reply immediately via the private email address below=2E 
Upon your response=2C I shall then provide you with more details and relevant documents that will help you understand=2E 
Please observe utmost confidentiality=2Cand rest assured that this transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall require your assistance to invest my share in your country=2E 
Awaiting your urgent reply via email=2E
