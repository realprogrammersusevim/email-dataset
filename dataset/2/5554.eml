Recently=2C my Doctor told me that I would not last for the next three  months due to cancer problem=2E Though what disturbs me most is my stroke sickness=2E Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to either a church=2Forganisation or devoted christain individual that will utilize this money the way I am going to instruct here- in=2E I want this church=2Forganisation or individual to use this money in all sincererity to
fund building church=2Corphanages=2Cwidows and also propagating the word of GOD and to ensure that the society upholds the views and beliefs of the holy
bible=2E 

The holy bible emphasized so much on GOD benevolence and this has encouraged me to take this bold step=2E I took this decision because I  don=92t have any child that will inherit this money=2C and I don=92t want my husband=92s hard earned money to be misused by people I call unbelievers=2E I don=92t want a situation where this money will be used in an unholy manner=2E Hence the reason for taking this bold decision=2E I know that after death I will be with GOD the most benevolent and the most merciful=2E I don=92t need any telephone communication in this regard because of my health and also of the presence of my husband=92s relatives around me always=2E 

I don=92t want them to know about this development=2E With GOD all things are possible=2E As soon as I receive your reply=2C I will forward it to my family attorney and I will then instruct him to give you the contact of the
Security Company=2E I will also issue you a letter of authority that will prove you as the original- beneficiary of this fund=2E I want you and the christains=2FMuslims communities where you reside to always pray for me=2E 

My happiness is that I lived a life of a true devoted christain worthy of emulation=2E Whoever that wants to serve the GOD must serve him in truth and in fairness=2E Please always be prayerful all through your life=2E Any delay in your reply will give me room in sourcing for a church=2Forganisation or a devoted christain for this same purpose=2E
