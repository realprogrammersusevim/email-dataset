Dear Sir,

My name is Mr.Mike Tutu;I work in a Security Company in 
Nigeria.There is an Investor from Democratic Republic of Congo [DRC] 
former Minister, who lodged some fund cash {for safekeeping in our 
company} 

I received instruction from him to look for a reliable 
foreign partner/investor who can receive and manage the fund for him 
until his ordeal with the Government is over, currently he is under 
detention and probe, his offence is political motivated {he is aspiring 
for the office of the president come next election} However the money 
originated from gratification/under the counter sales of copper in his 
ministry,The amount is $58,600,000.00 USD.
 
Kindly help you will be 
adequately rewarded for assisting.

Regards.
