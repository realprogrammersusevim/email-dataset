FROM: MRS. ELIZABETH OGALI
DEPARTMENT OF PETROLEUM RESOURCES
7 KOFO ABAYOMI STREET, VICTORIA ISLAND
LAGOS - NIGERIA.

Dear Friend,

This letter may come to you as a surprise but it was borne 
out of my sincere desire to share a mutual business 
relationship with you. First, your strictest confidence in 
this transaction is highly solicited. This is by virtue of 
its nature as being utterly confidential and top secret.

We are top government official with a statutory 
corporation and members of an ad hoc committee set up by 
the Federal Government of Nigeria to review contract 
awarded by past administration. In the course of 
identifying, scrutinizing and recommending for the payment 
of all valid contract executed, we discovered a huge sum 
of money amounting to USD41.5M (Forty One Million five 
Hundred Thousand US Dollars) on grossly over invoiced 
contract already awarded and executed for the Department 
of Petroleum Resources. Having Cleaned the 'AUGEAN STABLE' 
we intend to transfer the balance of USD41.5M presently 
floating in our apex bank of Nigeria to our own benefit 
and advantage.

However, we request for your unwavering assistance in this 
regard because as civil servants we are prohibited under 
the civil service code of conduct bureau from operating a 
foreign account or running a foreign company unless after 
retirement in this vain we want you to front for us as 
partner to enable us lodge the funds speedily into your 
account. Bear in mind that no risk is attached to this 
project and all logistics are in place and modalities 
worked out for the smooth conclusion within a stipulated 
time. This is in accordance with the fact that you must 
never betray the trust already reposed on you. We have 
decided to compensate you with 30% of the total sum for 
your support, 60% for us while 10% for miscellaneous 
expenses (local and international).

Please, provide your confidential phone and fax number to 
enable my boss contact you for further discussion on this 
matter to his private email address: (r_swafa@lycos.com)

Please advise in your return e-mail if any time is 
confidential enough to call you.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best regards,

Mrs Elizabeth Ogali
(Secretary of the Committe)
