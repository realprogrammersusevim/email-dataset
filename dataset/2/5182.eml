 BUSINESS PROPOSAL

Dear sir / Madam 


My name is DR, ADAMS OBOZUWA., a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up. Early last year there 
was a major oil spillage in the Niger Delta Region of 
Nigeria which rendered over 70% of the communities 
homeless.The contract was handled by a foreign firm but 
because of the huge monetary profit we envisaged we decided 
to over-invoice the contract sum. Now the contract has been 
completed and the original contractor has since been 
paid,but the contract balance of US$38 million,which 
resulted from the over invoiced contract sum that has been 
left in a suspense account with the DEBT RECONCILIATION 
COMMITTEE A SUBSIDIARY OF THE APEX BANK,is what me and my 
partners are planning to take out of the country for 
ourselves.The problem is as government officials,we are not 
suppose to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having 
foreign ones.To this end, we are soliciting your assistance 
as a foreign partner who can assist us and receive this 
amount into your account. We are ready to share this money 
with you on the basis of participation. We also have plans 
to invest part of this money in any viable business in your 
country under your care,as we are nearing our retirement 
age. In any case, I received a reference of 
you/organization from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and 
Industry =91Foreign Trade Division=92 as a reputable organ that 
can assist us on this transaction. Please if you accept my 
proposal do not hesitate to send me a fax on 234 1 759 0379 
or send me an e-mail on: 
adamuohiroma, so that I can provide you with the basic 
procedures for the release of the fund. It does not matter 
whether you or your company does contract project of the 
nature described here, the assumption is that you won a 
major contract and subcontracted it to another company, 
more often than not, big trading companies or individuals 
of unrelated field win major contracts here in Nigeria and 
subcontracts same to more specialized firms for execution. 
BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit this 
money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire funds, 70% 
will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been set aside 
to cover any expenses that may be incurred by both parties 
during this transaction, both local and international. 
Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost 
degree of maturity and confidentiality because I am still 
in active government service with the =93NIGERIAN NATIONAL 
PETROLEUM CORPORATION=94. If I receive your response on time, 
this whole transaction could be accomplished within the 
shortest possible time based on your interest and 
determination,since the money is already in transit. 
Please, try to call me up to confirm the receipt of your 
fax or e-mail.The lines may be busy,but keep trying till 
you get through. 

Yours faithfully, 

DR, ADAMS OBOZUWA. (MNIM)
