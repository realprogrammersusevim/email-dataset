DR.ERIC MORGAN

ABIDJAN,

COTE D' IVOIRE=20


Dearest Beloved,


I am Dr.Eric Morgan an account officer with Banque Internationale de L' a=
frique De L' Ouest Cote D' Ivoire. I am writing following an opportunity =
in my department here in the bank that will be of immense benefit to both=
 of us.=20


In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $10 million Ten millio=
n united states dollars) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign=
 customer the Late Mr Smith B.Andrea an American oil engineer with Petro =
Technical Services Sarl who unfortunately lost his life in the plane cras=
h of Alaska Airlines Flight 261 which crashed on January 31 2000, includi=
ng his wife.=20


You read more on the crash on visiting this Site.http://www.cnn.com/2000/=
US/02/01/alaska. airlines.list/smith.html.


Since we got information about his death, we have been expecting his next=
 of kin or relatives to come over and claim his money because we cannot r=
elease it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to th=
e deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.


Unfortunately I learnt that his supposed next of kin being his wife [Patt=
y Andrea] died along with him in the plane crash leaving nobody with the =
knowledge of this fund behind for the claim.=20


It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make business w=
ith you and release the money to you as the next of kin or beneficiary of=
 the funds for safety keeping and subsequent disbursement since nobody is=
 coming for it and we don't want this money to go back into Government tr=
easury as unclaimed bill.=20


The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remaine=
d after six and half years, the money will then be transferred into Gover=
nment treasury as unclaimed funds.=20


I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as the foreign partner, wh=
ile the balance will be for me. I will visit your country for the disburs=
ement according to the percentages indicated above once this money gets i=
nto your account.=20


Please be honest to me and trust is our watchword in this transaction. No=
te this transaction is confidential and risk free.


As soon as you receive this mail you should contact me by return mail.Ple=
ase note that all necessary arrangement for the smooth release of these f=
unds to your yet to be provided account has been finalised.=20


We will discuss much in details when I do receive your response. Please i=
n your response include your telephone number for easy communication betw=
een us.


Best Regards,

Dr Eric Morgan.
