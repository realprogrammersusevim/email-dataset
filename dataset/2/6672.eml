Dear sir,
 
I have a proposal foryou - this however is not mandatory nor will I in any manner compel you to go honour against your will.
 
 I am 35, and had worked with a bank (one of the African
 leading banks in the West Coast). Here in this bank
 existed a dormant account for the past 8 years which
 belong to a Syria national who is now late.
 
 When we discovered that there had been no deposits nor
 withdrawals from this account for this long period, I
 and my two other colleagues decided to carry out a
 system investigation and discovered that non of the
 family member nor relations of the late Syrian is
 aware of this account.
 
 This is the story in a nutshell.
 
 Now we want an account overseas where we can transfer
 this funds. Thereafter, we had planned to destroy all
 related documents for this account. It is a careful
 network and for the past eleven months we have worked
 out everything to ensure a hitch-free operation.
 
 
 The amount is not so much at the moment and plus all
 the accumulated interest the balance in this account
 stands at-US$9,000.000.00 million US dollars.
 
 Now our questions are:-
 
 1. Can you handle this project?
 2. Can we give you this trust?
 3. What will be your commission?
 
 Consider this and get back at us as soon as possible.
 
 Finally, it is our humble prayer that the information as
 contained herein be accorded the necessary
 attention, urgency as well as the secrecy it deserves.
 
 We Expect your urgent response if you can handle this
 project. send a mail for confirmation.
 
 
 Respectfully yours,
 
 MR.Daniel Innoma.
