Before he finally gave up in the hospital,he made me to understand that he deposited the total sum of Five million, Five
hundred thousand United State Dollars in a nearby country with a security firm and After his death, i was able to locate the documents relating to that deposit with the security company.

I have tried with all possibility to claim this consignment funds from the cargo company but following the principles and procedures of the diplomatic company that i must provide the next of kin to that deposit with the deposit certificate.
