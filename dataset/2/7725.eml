   RE: TRANSFER OF US$56.559 MILLION TO YOUR 
ACCOUNT.
    I am Dr. Harry Macdonald the operational manager in 
account Management section in charge of credit and foreign bills in a 
prime bank here in South Africa, On a routine inspection, I discovered 
a dormant domiciliary account with Balance of US$56,559,000(fifty six 
Million Five Hundred and Fifty) Nine Thousand U.S dollars Only).The 
account holder was in charge of President Saddam Hussein's secret crude 
oil transactions in Africa. On further discreet investigation, I 
discovered that the account holder died long ago with his family on a 
fatal Auto-accident leaving no beneficiary to the account and no other 
person knows about it. I am in close contact with the bank manager here 
who is my partner and is willing to approve the transfer to any 
reliable and trust worthy foreigner with foreign bank account because 
the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner.
    The account has no 
written or oral WILL attached to it, I will Provide the necessary 
information and documents needed in order to claim this money if you 
agree to receive this fund in your account pending my  arrival in your 
country for sharing,South African Civil Service Code of Conduct Laws  
prohibits Civil Servants from operating Private Foreign Accounts so on 
receipt of your approval to transfer the money to your account,i will 
start the necessary things to make the transaction a success.
Your 
urgent reply is highly needed, Hope to hear from you soon.
   
Yours 
Faithfully,
 Dr. Harry Macdonald
