Dear Sir/Madam,

My name is SUN MOYO,the elder son of Mr. JOHN MOYO of Zimbabwe. This might 
be a surprise to you about where I got your contact address. I got your 
address from the South African Chamber of Commerce in Johannesburg, South 
Africa.

During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supports of 
our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his party 
members and his followers, he ordered all white farmers to surrender all 
their farms to his party members and his followers.

My father is one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not 
support Mugabe's ideas, Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's farm and 
burnt everything in the farm, killing my father and made away with a lot of 
items in my father's farm.

Before his death, my father had deposited with one of the Security Company 
in Johannesburg, South Africa the sum of US$18.5 Million (Eighteen Million 
Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars).with my name,and made every 
documents with my name both the certificate of depositry.

Then after the death of my father, we decided to move to the Republic of 
South Africa where he had deposited the money in the Security Company as 
valuables.

So,I decided to contact you to assist me to transfer this money out of South 
Africa because as asylum seekers we are not allowed to operate any bank 
account within South Africa. We have agreed to offer you 20% of the total 
sum for your assistance, 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that may be 
incurred in the course of this transaction and 75% will be for me and my 
family to invest in your country.

All I want you to do is to furnish me with your full personal phone and fax 
numbers for easy communication. You can contact me on the above Telephone 
number.Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely 
confidential.

Thanks and God bless.

Best Regards.

MR. SUN MOYO.
{FOR THE FAMILY}
