Sir/Madam,


I am kester jones  An Accountant with Unity

Trust Bank Plc London UK.


I got contact from British Chamber of Commerce <br>
Industries Foreign Trade Department, On the cost of

my research for a Foreign partner who can assist me

for urgent and  confidential business Relationship.


  On January 7, 1996, An America Oil

consultant/contractor with the submit oil company

London UK, Engr. Kim Changho made a numbered time

(fixed) deposit for twelve calendar months, valued

at ?5,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling)

in my Bank upon maturity. I sent a rountine

notification to his forwarding address but got no

reply. After a month,we sent a reminder and finally

we discovered from one of their staff in The submit

oil company that Engr. Kim Changho is among the

passengers that perished in a plane crash [Korean

Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on

August 6, 1997. Since the demise of this our

customer..


On further investigation, i found out that he died

without making a  WILL, and attempts to trace his next of kin was

fruitless.I therefore made further investigation and

discovered that Engr. Kim Changho did not declare

any next of kin or relations in all his official

documents, including his Bank deposit paperwork in

my Bank. This sum of ?5,000,000.00 is still in my

bank and the interest is being rolled over with the

principal sum at the end of each year. No one will

ever come forward to claim it.According to the

British law, at the expiration of (10)years, the

money will revert to the ownership of the British

Government if nobody applies to claim the fund

Consequently, my proposal is that i will like you as

a foreigner to stand as the next of kin to late

Engr. Kim Changho, So that the fruit of this old

man's labour will not get into the hands of some

corrupt Government officials.


This is simple, I will like you to provide

immediately your full name and address so that the

Attorney will prepare the necessary documents and

affidavits which will put you in place as the next

of kin. We shall employ the service of an  Attorney

for the Drafting and Notarization of the WILL and

obtain the necessary documents and letter of

Probate/Administration in your favour for the

transfer. Any Bank account in any part of the world

which you will provide will then facilitate the

transfer of this money to you as the

beneficiary/next of kin.


The money will be paid into your account for us to

share in ratio of 55%  for me and 40% for you, While we keep 5% for 

local

and international expenses we might incure in the

cost of this transaction, Take Note: There is no

risk at all, the paperwork for this transaction will

be done by the Attorney and my position as the

Accountant guarantees the successful execution

of ths transaction.


If you are interested, please reply immediately,

upon your response,i shall provide you with more

details and relevant documents that will help you

understand the transaction. Please observe utmost

confidentiality and be rest assured that this

transaction would be most profitable for both of us

because i shall require your assistance to invest my

share in your country. Please if this proposal

satisfies you , upon the reciept of this mail

message, send to me the following to enable me start

the process of the fund into your bank account:


You shall read more about the crash on visiting

this:http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list


1. Your full Name and address

2. The name of your Bank where you want the fund to
