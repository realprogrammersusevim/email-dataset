Hello Friend,

   How are you hope you are fine?How is your family  hope
they are fine too.
   I wanted to discuss something with you,Its really
bothering me.I know you will be surprise how i got your email address,but
dont be
suprise i got it while i was browsing along the net also i know this will
sound somehow strange to you becos we have not meet phisically.But i
promise to be nice.

   I am about to tell you something that i have not
discuss with anyone excluding  my lawyer.My father was a big  time farmer
in south africa,he uses most of southafrica land for farming.The Govt in
southafrica gave him those lands for farming and he will pay back when he
got the money they gave him the land as loan .My father was very
successfull in the farming business and he paid all the Govt wanted back.

  Some top officials in the Govt were Jealous becos of his
wealth.They wanted him to Join them carry out a dubious deal against the
Govt but he refuse ,so they plan to   kill him  and claim all his wealth
in southafrica.On his way home one day he was coming from the office they
shot him  with a gun
and he was rushed to the hospital but he did not
survive it .But before they killed him he saw it coming  and transfer most
of his fund to a security company in Holland.He died in the hospital ,But
before he died he gave me the contact information of the security company
,as the
eldest daughter.

  Those people were looking for me and my family and
we ran to Nigeria for safety.I contacted the security company yesterday on
how i could collect the Money through  my lawyer and they told me that i
need a foreign beneficiary outside Africa becos of security reasons.And i
dont have anyone outside
africa that will stand for me as a beneficiarry.They
said the money was too big ($20m)My father never told me the amount of the
money i was so shock.My lawyer told me to look for a beneficiarry.That is
my problem
now,My mother is willing to give $7m to the person
that will help the family.Please  if you can help me in any way i will
appreciate it alot.I will like to hear from you soon ok.I will like you to
contact me through my private address,i will not get your message if you
dont write back to this address i have supplied you with
(lollyric@excite.com) I will like to
hear from you soon.GodBless you.
N.B  Any amount of money me andyou spend in clearing the consignment i
will pay you in double after we have clear the consignment.
  Lolly Richards.
