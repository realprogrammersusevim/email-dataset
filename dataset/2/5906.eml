=20
Dear Sir,=20
I would like to firstly send to you the best wishes of good health and succ=
ess in your pursuits particularly through my proposal as contained in this =
letter.
=20
Before going into details of my proposal to you, I must first implore you t=
o treat with the utmost confidentiality as this is required for its success=
 and to have faith in this transaction, for opportunities like this only co=
mes to one once in a life time.=20
My colleagues and I are senior officials of the Federal Government of my co=
untry's Contracts Review Panel (CRP) who are interested in diverting some f=
unds that are presently floating in the accounts of the Apex Bank of my cou=
ntry. In order to commence this transaction, we solicit for your assistance=
 to enable us transfer into your nominated account the said floating funds.=
 We are determined to conclude the transfer before the end of this quarter =
of 2003
.=20
The source of the funds are as follows: During the last military regime in =
my country, government officials set up companies and awarded themselves co=
ntracts that were grossly over-invoiced in various ministries and parastata=
ls. The present civilian government set up the Contract Review Panel, which=
 has the mandate to use the instruments of payments made available to it by=
 the decree setting up the panel, to review these contracts and if necessar=
y pay those who are being owed outstanding amounts.
=20
My colleagues and I have identified quite a huge sum of these funds, which =
are presently floating in our (Apex) Central Bank, ready for disbursement a=
nd would like to divert some of it for our own purposes.
However, by virtue of our positions as civil servants and members of this p=
anel, we cannot acquire these funds in our names or in the names of compani=
es that are based in my country. I have therefore been mandated, as a matte=
r of trust by my colleagues in the panel, to look for a reliable overseas p=
artner into whose account we can transfer the sum of U.S.$20,500,000.00  (T=
wenty million, five hundred thousand U.S. dollars). That is why I am seekin=
g your assistance. We have agreed to share the money to be transferred into=
 your account, if you agree with our proposition as follows;
=20
(i) 25% to the account owner (you).=20
(ii) 65% for us (the panel officials).=20
(iii) 10% to be used in settling all expenses (by both=20
you and us) incidental to the actualization of this project.
=20
We wish to invest our share of the proceeds of this project in foreign stoc=
k markets and other viable business till we are ready and able to have acce=
ss to them without raising any eyebrows here at home. Please note that this=
 transaction is 100% safe and risk-free.
=20
We intend to effect the transfer within fourteen (14) banking days from the=
 date of receipt of the following information through the fax number stated=
 above: Your company's name, address, telephone and fax numbers; we will us=
e your company=92s name to  apply for the payment and backdate the award of=
 the contract in favour of your company. We are looking forward to doing th=
is transaction with you and we solicit for your utmost confidentiality in t=
his transaction.
=20
I will bring you into a more detailed picture of this transaction when I he=
ar from you. Please get in touch either through my email address above or m=
y American internet FAX number 1 775 535 4598.TEL +234 1 775 7784
 Best regards,
