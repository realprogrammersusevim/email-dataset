of Liberia, West
Africa.


Attn: President/CEO

I am Mrs. Jewel Howard Taylor, an 
Americo-Liberian by
birth and wife of 
embattled President of war torn 
Liberia, Mr Charles
Taylor. I am an 
economist by profession. My 
husband was just caught in
Nigeria, but matters 
were not helped when 
UN Special War Crimes
 Court for Sierra Leone indicted my husband for 
war
crimes , demanding his prosecution.  
I am awaiting the
outcome of 
events in my 
country, and what will become of me and my husband in
asylum. The reason
 is this. During the political crisis some years ago
in Sierra Leone (West
 African Country rich in diamonds), my husband 
was
actively involved.
Early this year, he entrusted some large 
quantities of
diamonds to me. 
Fearing its detection due to the volume, 
my
son (Williams) 
traveled to Dublin,Ireland with the diamonds (on my
instructions) and sold them,
 getting a total of US$28,000,000.00 
(Twenty Eight 
million US Dollars 
only). This money he moved into a 
safe Finance House
for protective 
custody under a different name.
Now, 
the  government of Dublin,Ireland has refused issuing
neither him nor 
my 
family any visa to travel to their country again
because of the 
current 
political situation. This is why I need you to please
 to  
claim this money and subsequently deposit
same in a reputable
 bank 
there for onward transfer to your account, or to
instruct the safe
 
house to move the funds out of there  to any of their
corresponding 
banks or offices in London or Europe for onward
transfer to your 
account.
I am also willing to forfeit any percentage you want.
 My only 
daughter Helen died in October 1999 from
complications of 
pneumonia. 
Please note that my husband is not even
aware that I sold the
 
diamonds, 
If you cannot help us, simply destroy and forget I
ever 
contacted you. 
  
May God guide you in whatever you decide, and thank
you for taking out 
time to read this request.
Fondest regards.

Mrs. 
Jewel Howard Taylor
