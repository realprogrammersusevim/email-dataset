Attention please
Compliments to you; I sincerely apologize for the intrude into your private=
 life, however I have a serious project which I believe would be of interes=
t to you and for this reason I reached out to you. I am Barrister Kenneth O=
bi. I worked as an attorney to an Oil Servicing company {CEDRY INCORPORATED=
} from 1980 to 1996 when the company liquidated. Cedry liquidated and folde=
d as a result of mismanagement and feud amongst the directors. On the 11th =
of June 1986, the company secretary and I took a LIFE ASSURANCE POLICY for =
the Chairman of the company for a period of TWENTY YEARS, which is from Jun=
e 1986 till June 2006. This LIFE POLICY was taken from a reputable Insuranc=
e Company here called STANDARD TRUST INSURANCE PLC. The premium for this Li=
fe policy was paid upfront by the Cedry because it is a long-term policy.
In 1996, Cedry was folded but Standard Trust Insurance Company did not term=
inate the Life Policy we took for the Chairman because we did not apply  fo=
r cancellation or termination of the Policy. On December 2006, I got a lett=
er from Standard Trust Insurance notifying me that the LIFE POLICY we took =
for Cedry Chairman was due and that I should come to their office for furth=
er discussions. I went to their office and they told me that they have Thre=
e Million Dollars accrued over a period of twenty years to pay to the Chair=
man of liquidated Cedry as SURRENDER VALUE for the Life Policy the company =
took for him. The Insurance Company knew that Cedry was folded and they ask=
ed me to provide the Chairman or his relative to receive the money.
Since 2006 till date I have searched for the Chairman without success. I we=
nt back to tell the Insurance Company that the Chairman is very old and sen=
ile to the extent that his sight is very bad and that he cannot do anything=
 for himself as he is almost a vegetable. The Insurance Company told me to =
get any of  the Chairman=92s relative with his authorization to claim the s=
urrender value for him. I have resolved to get any person or any person bea=
ring same name as the Chairman to stand as his relative to receive the surr=
ender value. If we don't claim this money,  no one would and the money woul=
d be retained in the coffers of the Insurance Company as their profit. I fe=
el it is rather appropriate that we team up and claim this money and use so=
me percentage of it to help the poor and the less privilege in our society =
than allow the Insurance Company to retain it as profit.
I contacted you in trust believing that you will not run away with the mone=
y if it enters your account. The Insurance Company have very high respect a=
nd regards for me and will be obliged to released the Surrender Value to wh=
oever I present to them as heir to the Chairman. I will obtain for you all =
that is required to execute this transaction successfully. I have in my fil=
e some documents for the existence of the Cedry and the Life Policy. I will=
 send to you once you indicate your interest. I will also send a claim appl=
ication specimen to you, which you will fill and send to the Insurance Comp=
any for the release of the surrender value to your account. Your share for =
assisting in this transaction will be One Million Dollars. If you cannot ex=
ecute this transaction for any reason, please introduce someone who is capa=
ble and I will reward you with Fifty thousand dollars after the transaction=
. Reply urgently if you are interested to execute this with me. Regards,Bar=
rister Kenneth Obi
