Letter From: Daniel Kabila
Johannesburg, South Africa

INVESTMENT OFFER

Greetings,
 In appreciation of your esteemed contact received through a reliable source 
and the choice of your country I wish to introduce myself, I am Daniel 
Kabila the son of the late Democratic Republic of Congo President Laurent 
Desire Kabila of the blessed memory. I know this letter might come to you as 
a surprise but I honestly do not intend to surprise you. I write this letter 
in respect of my intention to invest the sum of Twelve Million United State 
Dollars with you. I inherited this money from my mother. This money was got 
through the smuggling and sale of Diamond and Timber when my father was the 
head of state. My mother though not her legal wife used her privilege 
position to engage in the business of Diamond and Timber since she knows 
that her survival will depend on how much she can get out of the privilege 
situation.

When my father was assassinated on 16TH Jan. 01 by one of his bodyguards 
Lt.Rashidi Kasereke through the conspiracy of some top army officers that 
wanted to topple him I escaped to South Africa because of the fear that I 
might be arrested by my half brother Lt. General Joseph Kabila the present 
head of state. Actually his mother and my mother are not in the best of 
relationship because of who among them will be the first lady tussle and 
this ultimately affected us their children. Considering the relationship 
between South Africa and the Democratic Republic of Congo new government, my 
mother advised me to leave For South Africa for security reason, while the 
funds were deposited with a security Company in Europe.

On getting to South Africa where I have been living since then as a 
political refugee I am seeking for a reliable foreigner who can assist me in 
moving this money out for safe banking and profitable investment. Honestly I 
contacted you because I don't want to invest this money in South Africa due 
to my status here as a political Refugee. And moreover I wouldn't want to 
take risk because this money is all that I and my Mother is depending on 
because My half brother has seized all my father's assets and money and left 
I and my mother empty handed without knowing about this funds deposited at 
the Security Company in Europe so that is why I decided that investing this 
money abroad should be the best investment for me. I will be honored if I 
can be given the privilege of investing this money with your help.

In view of this plight, I expect you to be trustworthy and kind enough to 
respond to this distress call to save my mother and I from a hopeless 
future. And if you agree, I hereby agree to compensate your sincere and 
candid effort in this regard with 20% of the total money and annual 5% of 
the after tax returns on investment for the first three years. Thereafter, 
the term shall be varied 5% for expenses, which may arise during the 
transaction, fax and phone bills inclusive. When the money is moved into 
your discrete account, you will be allowed to draw 20% your favor, while the 
remaining 70% will be invested meaningfully for our future if possible in 
your area of business and deterrents sectors of the Economy in your country 
which are dividends yielding. 

Whatever your decision is please reach me immediately and keep this letter 
tight secret for the interest of my family. 

Best Regards,
Daniel Kabila
