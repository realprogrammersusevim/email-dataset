Now all firms involved have been paid accordingly and the project commissioned. At this juncture therefore, we want to transfer this inflated
sum to a trusted foreigner&#8217;s account as the true beneficiary, through the Central Bank of Nigeria. We as Civil Servants are not allowed to operate foreign Account.


BENEFIT: we have therefore, agreed to give you 30% of the amount, while 5% will be set aside to offset any expenses incurred during the transaction. And 65% will be for us the officials.

REQUIREMENT: All modalities have efficiently and secretly worked out with the top officials of the Federal Ministry of Finance and Central Bank of Nigeria to facilitate the remittance of this fund into your Account within 7 /14 working days of receiving the following Bank information from you.

All your replies should be strictly on my direct e-mail address. This transaction is 100% free and does not depend on any specific field of trade. Reach me on the above email if you are interested in my proposal.
