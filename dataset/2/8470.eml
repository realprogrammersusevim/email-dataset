attorney to the President Federal Republic of Nigeria,Chief Olusegun Obas=
anjo.

I have specifically been mandated by His Excellency to source for a forei=
gn business partner for a joint business venture.

His Excellency would be vacating the seat of power come may
2007 and therefore,he has a certain amount of USD$300,000.000.00(Three hu=
ndred million dollars) which he wants to invest overseas with a reliable =
foreign partners,hence I am contacting you.

As a matter of fact,I have already told Mr.President that I knew someone =
in oversea, a business mogul whom I trusted and believed that could handl=
e these arrangement successfully. Though,His excellency is looking at the=
 area of setting up a private oil refinery or Real Estate,but that does n=
ot mean that any other viable and lucrative business is a bad idea.

If you are interested and capable of handling this arrangement please,kin=
dly write and indicate your capability and furnish me with your present l=
ine of business.

Let me also know your country of origin and your proposed country of the =
said investment. More details would be given to you upon my receipt of yo=
ur urgent response.
