FROM THE DESK OF DON HOSE NANDO
AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING MANEGER =2C
BANCO POPULARE DE ESPANA=2E


Dear Friend=2C

I am the manager of billing and exchange at the
foreign remittance department of BANCO POPULARE DE ESPANA here in Madrid Spain=2E In my department=2E we discovered an abandoned sum of =3F=3Fm euros =28FOURTY Million
euros=29 in an account that belongs to one of our
foreign customer =28MR=2E Rudi Fassnacht from Cologne=2C Germany=29 who died along with his entire family in Jully 2000 in a
plane crash=2EFor more informations about the crash you
can visit this site=3A

http=3A=2F=2Fnews=2Ebbc=2Eco=2Euk=2F1=2Fhi=2Fworld=2Feurope=2F859479=2Estm

Since we got information about his death=2C we have been
expecting his next of kin to come over and claim his
money because we cannot release it unless some body
applies for it as next of kin or relation to the
deceased as indicated in our banking guidlings and
laws but unfortunately we
learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation
died alongside with him at the plane crash leaving
nobody behind for the claim=2E It is therefore upon this
discovery that I now decided to make this business
proposal to you and release the money to you as the
next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and
subsequent disbursement since nobody is coming for it
and we don't want this money to go into the Spanish
treasury government account as unclaimed funds=2E

The banking law and guidline here stipulates that if
such money remained unclaimed after five years=2C the
money will be transfered into the government treasury
account as unclaimed funds=2E The request of foreigner
as next of kin
in this business is occassioned by the fact that the
customer was a foreigner and a Spanish cannot stand as
next of kin to a foreigner=2E

I agree that 30% of this money will be for you as a
respect to the provision of a foriegn account =2C10%
will be set aside for expenses incurred during the
business and 60% will be invested in any lucrative
business of your choice and as soon as this is done=2C i
will resign from my work and join you immediatelly=2E
Remmember that the trust leed upon you is based on
mutual business understanding and a life time
opportunity which i believe you will not allow it go=2E

To enable the immediate transfer of this fund to you
as arranged=2Cyou must apply first to the bank as
relation or next of kin of the deceased with a text of
application 
that i will send to you=2Cso i will like you to send to
me your private telephone and fax number for easy and
effective communication and location where the money
will be remitted=2E

Upon receipt of your reply=2C I will send to you by fax
or email the text of the application =2E I will not fail
to bring to your notice this transaction is hitch-free
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as
All required arrangements have been made for the
transfer=2E You should contact me immediately as soon as
you receive this letter=2E

Trusting to hear from you immediately=2Esend all
correspondence by email don=5Fhosenando=40yahoo=2Ecom for
security reasons

Yours Faithfully=2C
