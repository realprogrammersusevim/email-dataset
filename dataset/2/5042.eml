Dear webmaster =2C

Union Bank Of Nig=2E Plc          
Union House Marina              
Lagos State
Nigeria=2E

PRIVATE AND CONFIDENTIAL

Dear Sir=2Fmadam

I sincerely write to seek your co-operation and trust
to enable my colleagues and I carry out an urgent
business opportunity in my department=2E I work with the
Union Bank of Nigeria PLC=3B currently I am the senior
manager of bills and exchange at the foreign
remittance department of my bank=2E I was the account
officer to one Mr=2E Ali B=2E Ashraf who died along with
his family on the 8th of November 1996 in an ADC
Boeing 727 plane crash at Egirin River=2E All 141
passengers on board were feared dead=2E

He left in his domiciliary account the total sum of
Sixty Five Million United States Dollars =5B$65million=5D 
Since the management got the information of his
death we have been expecting any of his relation or
his next of kin to come up and claim his money=2E
Unfortunately from the day of his death till the time
of this letter none of his relation or friends has
come up for the claim=2E The banking and financial law
of Union bank of Nigeria Plc stipulates that if such
fund remained unclaimed after a period of four years =284=29 it
will be transferred into the bank treasury as
unclaimed bill=2E On this discovery sir=2C I and a colleague of mine
now decided do business with you and
release the money to you as the next of kin to Ali B=2E
Ashraf for safety and subsequent disbursement=2E I will
soon proceed for my retirement in the middle of  this year=2C and I
personally do not want this fund to be transferred
into the bank treasury as unclaimed bill=2E That is why
I wanted the fund to be move out of the bank before I
proceed on my retirement from the banking services by
june 15th 2003=2E

The need for a foreigner as next of kin in this
project is occasioned by the fact that the customer
Mr=2E Ali Ashraf was a foreigner and a Nigerian cannot
stand as his next of kin or heir=2E We have agreed that
15% of the Fund would be for you as foreign partner=3B
thereafter my colleague and I will visit your country
for disbursement according to the percentages
indicated=2E To enable the immediate transfer of the
fund into your nominated account=2C you will first apply
to the bank as the next of kin of the deceased=2C
indicating your bank account number and location
wherein the money will be remitted=2E Upon receipt of
your acknowledgement indicating your interest=2C I will
send to you the text of the application that you will
send to the Union Bank authority for an approval to
submit your claims=2E 

Send your reply through my direct  private email
address and indicate  your direct
Fax and telephone numbers for effective communication
that this transaction is required=2E Do not reply through the
union bank email address because it will fall at the receptionist's
desk and is for public use =2E


Please note that you are not to appear in person=2C as
every thing regarding this project will be strictly on
documentations and every banking documents needed for
this transaction will be taken care of by my self=2E

Looking forward to urgently hearing from you=2E

Yours Faithfully

MR=2E DONALD  ATTAH
