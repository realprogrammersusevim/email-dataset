Dear Sir/Madam,

		HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL
Greetings,

This letter may come to you as a surprise but I plead
with you to patiently read through it before making a
decision whether to assist me or not.

I wish to solicit for your assistance in this
transaction, which I strongly believe, will be of
mutual benefit to both of us.

My name is DAVIS TUTU, a branch manger of a
leading bank in South Africa (ABSA Bank), my
colleagues and I wish to seek your assistance in the
transfer of some huge sum of money (USD$35M) into a
foreign bank account.

An American national deposited this money in a fixed
deposit account in the bank, six years ago. The length
of time for the maturity of the fixed deposit was five
years, which expired towards the ending of last year.
Incidentally, MR. JEFF STEVENS, who was the
beneficiary died in the September 11th bombing of the
World Trade Center in America, and he left MR DAVID
STEVENS as the Next-of-kin to claim this money, but
unfortunately he was said to have died of cancer few months after
Jeff's death. All efforts made to trace any known
relations of both proved abortive, and no one has
written our bank in this regard.

All modalities for the successful transfer of this
money into an offshore bank account have been put in
place and we are looking for a trust worthy foreign
partner into whose bank account this fund would be
remitted to and it is in this regard that my
colleagues have mandated me to provide a partner who
will assist us. We have agreed to compensate you with
20% of the total amount if you should accept to assist
us.

If you are interested in giving us the required
assistance, kindly reply this letter stating your
Telephone/Fax numbers for further action. Because of
the secrecy surrounding this transaction, I suggest
that you send a fax me or call and i will contact you
for futher details.

I am looking forward to a favorable reply from you
soon. Feel free to ask any question in this regard.

I remain,

Yours Faithfully,

Davis Tutu
