Salam

I am Mr. Ali Hussein    from  Basra Iraq I am writing you this email as  a 
Muslim brother,

As you and I know about the unrest in my country, I want to use this means 
to apple for your help to relocate my family and funds (US$4Million ) to 
your country.

As I just lost my wife some month ago because of the unrest here in Basra 
and I have my 8months baby with me now.

Hope to hear from you
Assalam ualaikum
