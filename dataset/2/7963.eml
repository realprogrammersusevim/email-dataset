Beloved in Christ,

It is a priviledge to hear from God and it gives me
joy to relate my testimony to you haven recieved
instruction from God through divine revelation.

I was a Moslem and a retired military top officer in
Nigerian Army that served under the past military
regime. I was the financial secretary to the Armed
Force Ruling Council (AFRC). With my position as a 
financial secretary, I was able to secure up to
$146,000,000.00(One hundred and fourty  six million us
dollars which i deposited with a finance and security
company in a country that will be disclosed to you
later as you indicate interest. I wanted to use this
fund to context for the post of the president of
Nigeria in the next republic.


Immediately I got retired, I was converted from Moslem
to Christian when I was preached the words of God
through my cousin the pastor of my church I then gave
my life to Christ and became a born again Christain.

Since I gave my life to Christ, I had no rest of mind.
Some times I think of the souls I killed when I was a
soldier and the dubious ways I diverted my countrys
money into my Personal Bank Account. I then decided to

seek the face of God for forgiveness and after fasting
and prayer through Divine Revelation, the Almighty God
revealed to me that the only way I could have rest of
mind is when I used my wealth to do the work of God. 
I have been thinking of the particular thing to do for
my God before this present civilian president of my
country set up  a panel(Honourable Oputa Panel) to
probe the Bank Account of the past Military officers
like me. They suceeded in finding out the funds I have
in my personal Bank accouts in Nigeria and they have
seized all my money.I am still facing their charges
but i have refused to disclose to them that i have
such money somewhere and they can never find out
because I want to use part of it to do the work of
GOD.

I have decided to use part of this fund for charity
instead of loosing it to my government. I am presently
under house arrest and my movement is restricted.The
consignments that contained the money is now
accumulating demurage in the country because the
agreement time with the security company has passed. I
have been  making arrangement to sneak out and clear
it but I can not travel out now.I sent a message to
the security company that I am sending somebody to
come and claim the consignments.I want a honest
christain who will not run away with my money and who
will be honest to use part of the fund for things of
God and let the name of the lord be glorify and so
that I can have rest of mind as the Lord told me.If
you are interested in going to claim the fund,I will
disclose to you where i deposited the money and every
document to claim the fund will be fax to you.

I am still making arrangement to see if I can sneak
out of the country with my family.As soon as you claim
the fund,please use half of it for GOD`S WORK and keep
half of it for me till I come over to meet you.
If you are interested in going,please send to me your
full names,address to submit it to the security
company as the person coming to claim the
consignments. 

I look forward to your response

God bless you.

Deacon   pastor faith.
