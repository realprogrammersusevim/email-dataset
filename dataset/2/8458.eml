<P>Dear Sir/Madam</B> </P><B>
<P>Forgive me if this letter comes to you as a surprise due to the fact t=
hat we do not know each other in person. I got your address from the Sout=
h African Chambers of Commerce through a reliable source I am FELIX TAYLO=
R; the younger brother of to the Ex. President of LIBERIA CHARLES TAYLOR,=
 the Ex. President TAYLOR is being step down as the president of Liberia.=
 He has resigned and seek asylum in Nigeria country due to pressures moun=
ted on him by the international community especially the UNITED STATE OF =
AMERICA. My Brother has resign as president in order to give peace a chan=
ce in our country Liberia. </P>
<P>CHARLES TAYLOR has been a freedom fighter that fought all his life for=
 the well being of Liberians. But due to the multi tribal nature of our c=
ountry, REBELS From the enemy tribes have fought the ruling government of=
 CHARLES TAYLOR, to the point where it has become impossible to maintain =
peace and tranquility. Presently we want to have some more time to reloca=
te our wealth from Liberia to other foreign countries, where we can secre=
tly invest our wealth profitably and peacefully. As of now, the president=
 is now in NIGERIA where he is on asylum, the rest of our family includin=
g my three brothers and wife and children have left Liberia to seek refug=
e in foreign countries where they can have security and peace of mind. I =
am currently living in South Africa where I am living in asylum as a poli=
tical refugee. </P>
<P>This is why I am writing you. On my arrival to South Africa, I come wi=
th the sum of US$18,000,000,00 (EIGHTEEN MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS)</=
P>
<P>This money was given to me by Ex. PRESIDENT TAYLOR to buy military arm=
s and ammunitions from South African allies. These ammunitions were meant=
 to be used to curtail the insurgence of rebel forces into the capital ci=
ty of Monrovia. Ex. president Taylor therefore instructed me to find a re=
liable partner that will assist me to transfer this money to a foreign ac=
count for my personal use. Currently the money is deposited in a private =
security company here in South Africa as classified consignment. And the =
security company does not know the real contents of this consignment. I s=
imply deposited the money as diplomatic valuables to avoid the security c=
ompany from interfering with the money. I shall want you to help me trans=
fer this money overseas. </P>
<P>I will appreciate if you can provide me with a bank account in a stabl=
e bank where we can transfer this money. I shall also want you to assist =
me in investing this money in any profitable venture for the future of my=
 family. </P>
<P>I am fed up of the disorganization and political instability of this C=
ONTINENT thus I shall want to relocate my fund and my family to an overse=
a country where peace, security, political stability as well as financial=
 consistency are all guaranteed. </P>
<P>You will be given a commission for your assistance and other details o=
f this transactions will be discussed when I receive your reply indicatin=
g your interest and readiness to assist me. I must also assure you that t=
his transaction is totally legal and bears no risk whatsoever now or in t=
he future.</B> </P><B>
<P>I have all the documents covering this money which I can send you if y=
ou desire. My family friends in the government and banking sectors here i=
n South Africa will also help to make this transfer successful within the=
 shortest time in the most legal way. They have assured me of their suppo=
rt. </P>
<P>ALL I ASK FROM YOU ARE TRUST AND CONFIDENTIALITY. </P>
<P>YOUR TELEPHONER AND FAX NUMBERS IS URGENT</P>
<P>You are therefore to contact me immediately with the contact details p=
rovided above to discuss further details regarding this transaction. Than=
ks as I look forward to immediate response. </P>
