Mr.Eric Wong.
99 Queens Road,
Central London
UK,



I write you in good faith, hoping that you will treat this
letter as a desperate search for assistance in a matter that
shall benefit both of us.

A random search based on your locality from the Internet
produced your address, Please i apologise for this medium of
contact as it appears the only definate way i can have assistance with
this matter.

I am Mr Eric Wong,Former Head of Private Banking, Union Bank
Of China,Presently based in London, United Kingdom.Also
account Manager to a deceased Immigrant property magnate who
was based in the U.K, and had vast business interest in Hong Kong and
and China ,also referred to as my client.

On Monday, 31 July, 2000, 13:22 GMT 14:22 UK , my client,
his wife and their two Children died in the Air France
concord plane crash bound for New York in their plan for a world cruise

I have been managing his  Bank accounts in Hong Kong, and
some Properties which he had put out for sale. The properties which
have long been put out on sale have been paid for, and
the money paid has long been deposited into his local bank account
here. I have contacted you to assist in repatriating the money and
estate left behind by my client before they get confiscated or declared
unserviceable by my Former Bank. Particularly, the bank has issued me
with a notice to provide any of his next of kin or have the account
confiscated within a short period of time.My late client has an account
is valued at 18 Million United States Dollars Only

I therefore made further investigation,with the personel
department and discovered that did not declare any kin or
relations in all his official documents, including his Bank Deposit
paperwork in my Bank. This sum of US$18million is still sitting in my
Former Bank and the interest is being rolled over with the principal
sum at the end of each year. No one will ever come forward to claim it.
According  to Laws of Hong Kong, at the expiration of 5 (five) years,
the money will revert to the ownership of the Hong Kong Government if
nobody applies to claim the fund.

I now seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to
my deceased client, so that the proceeds of his account
valued at 18 Million United States Dollars Only can be paid to you,
I will like you to provide immediately your full names and address so
that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents and affidavits
that will put you in place as the next of kin.

The money will be paid to you for us to share in the ratio
of 60% for me and 35% for you and 5%, after completion,for
Expenses Incurred in the course of the transaction .There is no risk
at all as all the paperwork for this transaction will be done by the
attorney and withmy position as the Head Private Banking guarantees the
successful execution of this transaction. If you are interested, please
reply immediately to my email: erickw111@ommail.com

All I require is your honest co-operation to enable us see
this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach
of the law. Trust me as his Manager of his Estates, as i have all the
needed information, that this is a risk-free relationship.You
should observe utmost confidentiality, and rest assured that this
transaction would be most profitable for both of us because I shall
require your assistance to invest my share in your country.

Awaiting your urgent reply.

Thanks and regards.

Eric Wong.
