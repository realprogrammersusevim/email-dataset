Dear Friend,

My name is SALIM IBRAHIM a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E. I have been diagnosed with Esophageal cancer. It has defiled all forms of medical treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to Live, according to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my Life so well, as I never really cared for anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on 
my business as that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all these as I now know that there are more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I 
would live my Life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that 
God has called me, I have willed and given most of my property and 
assets to my immediate and extended family members as well as a few 
close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided 
to give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some 
charity organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my 
health has deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and 
distribute the money which I have there to charity organization in 
Bulgaria and Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. 

Hence, I do not trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended 
with what I have left for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge cash deposit of $20,500,000.00(Twenty Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S Dollars) that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have set aside 15% for you, then 5% for any expenses insured.

God be with you.

SALIM IBRAHIM
