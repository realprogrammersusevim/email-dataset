 Sir,

 I am a serving officer with the custom and exercise
 in my country and during my duties in the
 international airport we confiscated some boxes
 that came into the country from china and on
 opening we discovered that it was genuine dollar
 notes well packed with lace materials, as honest
 and dedicated officers we handed over these
 seized boxes to the government, After further
 investigation we discovered that these boxes were
 brought in by some retired generals and
 disgruntled politicians to truncate our political
 dispensation, but to our surprise theses boxes
 were handed over to them and money was used in
 areas for the election. Then just recently before
 the swearing in ceremony of our president we came
 across another set of six boxes containing the
 same items as officers we know that the same
 process will be applied we now took two of these
 boxes containing USD$ 60M(sixty Million Dollars)
 which we have taken out of the country.
 As serving officers we are not allowed to
 operate foreign account or seen to be involved in
 business of any kind so we therefore seek your
 assistance to collect this money and invest it
 for us to a time when we will be retired, if
 this offer is acceptable to you we will
 compensate you with certain percentage that will
 be worked out by both parties and an agreement
 will be drawn to protect both parties. kindly
 assist us as you will be duly rewarded.
 For further inquiries please send a mail to my
 mail box or after have get reply i we provid with my
 telphone number . Please note that if you cannot
 attend to our request kindly destroy this document
 so as not to joepardise our position were we work.
reply through my alternavite email:james@awis.zzn.com 

 Thanks for your cooperation.

 MR.OKI JAMES
