laws and guidlines.I was however notified to have the next of kin claim 
this money but several enquries i made inorder to get in contact with 
his possible relation revealed that his supposed relations were among 
those in the plane crash leaving nobody for the claim.
The banking laws

the bank as the next of kin to enable the release and payment of this 
funds to you b'cos i dont want this funds to be diverted into the bank
