FROM MR HAMSA AHMED.
AUDITING/REMITTANCE DEP,
BANK OF AFRICA (BOA).
OUAGADOUGOU BURKINA-FASO.

Dear Friend,

I am mr.hamsa ahmed.I work with the audit/remittance department in (BOA) 
bank of Africa ouagadougou burkina Faso. I have a business which will be 
beneficial to both of us. The amount of money involved is (18.2m dollars us) 
which i want to transfer out of the country to your bank account, all to my 
financial benefit and yours too. And also to take my wife to usa for 
treatment of liver damage.

This money is owned by a man called Kurt Kahie a business commercialist in 
west-Africa regions.

He has been dead since six years ago and since then no claim has been placed 
on his bank account balance. I want to transfer this money out of the 
country but such fund can not be transferred without a next of kin attached 
to the fund.

The fund could be transferred in these ways; you shall present yourself as 
business associates to the deceased person (Kurt Kahie) as details shall be 
that you are the care-taker business associates to Mr.Kurt Kahie and his 
properties. I shall make available to you materials and information with 
which a successful claim shall be placed on the fund.

I shall be your guidance and instructor throughout the duration of this 
transaction so as to ensure a swift and sure transfer of the fund to your 
bank account. As to your benefits, you shall be entitled to 40% of this fund 
for your co-operation in this transaction while 5% will be set aside for 
expenses both of us incurred during the course of this transaction. So if 
you are interested, send a reply to me immediately and in your reply please 
include your (private phone and your fax numbers) urgency has to be implied 
and this business must strictly be a deal between both of us.


Best Regard's

Mr Hamsa Ahmed.
