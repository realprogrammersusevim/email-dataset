Good day,



Certainly yes, this proposal may come to you as a surprise. It is 

a privilege and it demands an utmost confidentiality and honesty. My 

name is Mrs. Mary Kabah wife of the former minister of mineral 

resources/economic planning in the presidency of tijan Kabah of Sierra Leone. My 

husband died recently as a result of an acute heart problem.



Right now, the funds are in a security company which has affiliate 

offices in Europe, Asia and West African. I am currently on transit 

awaiting an honest overseas partner for negotiations.



Though it is my desire to go into property investments or any other 

area of your choice you may advice. I will compensate for your assistance including any expenses you may incur before the 

successful completion of this transaction.



So if youre interested to assist in this regard, kindly confirm this 

message upon receipt

next line of action and give you enough details and how we will work 

things out.
