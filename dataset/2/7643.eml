with due respectand regard.
 
I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be bene=
ficialto
both of us at the end of the transaction.
 
During our investigations and Accounting auditing in this bank, my depart=
ment
cameacross a very huge sum of money belonging to a deceased person who di=
ed
withhis entire family on FEBRUARY 14,2002 in an AUTO CRASH along BURKINA
FASO/LOME-TOGOEXPRESS WAY in WEST AFRICA and the fund has been dormant in=

his account withthis Bank without any claim of the fund in our custody ei=
t
her from his familyor relation before our discovery to this development.

 
Although personally, I keep this information secret within myself  to ena=
ble
thewhole plans and idea be Profitable and successful during the time of
execution.The said amount was us$14M (Fourteen million united states doll=
ars).
 
As it may interest you to know, I got your contact informations through
south africannetwork online  programme and after i prayed for GOD'S devin=
e
mercies,i decidedto contact you over this enterpresing transcation that

problem.

r
interest and willingnessto assist me and al so benefit your self to this
great business opportunity. 
 
In fact I could have done this deal alone but because of my posi tion in
this countryas a civil servant, we are not allowed to operate a foreign
account and wouldeventually raise an eye brow on my side during the time
of transfer because Iwork in this bank. 
 
This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow wh=
o
willforward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to
the Bankand also present a foreign account where he will need the money
to be re-transferredinto on his request as it may be after due verificati=
on
and clarification bythe correspondent branch of the bank where the whole
money will be remitted fromto your own designation bank account. 
 
May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as
I havemade arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you. 
On smooth conclusion of this transaction, you will b e entitled to 25% of=

the totalsum as gratifications,while 5% will be set aside to take care of=

Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as i'm still in service
and intendto retire from service after we conclude this deal with you.
