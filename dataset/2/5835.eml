>From Mr.Jim Nelson,
# 41 Easton Street,
London WC1X 0DW, UK
Occupations: External Auditor

Attn;

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal
ethics although I wish to use this medium to get in touch with you first
because it's fastest means. I am a staff in the account section of a know=
n
bank here in the United Kingdom.

In one of our periodic auditing I disproved a dormant account with holdin=
g
balance of =A315,000,000.00 (Fifteen Million British
Pounds) which has not been operated for the past three years. From my
investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account, a foreigner
by name Mr James Williams  died in July 19,2003 and since then nobody has
done anything as regards the claiming of this money because he has no
family members who are aware of the existence of neither the account nor
the funds.

I have secretly discussed this matter with a top senior minister official
of the federal ministry of  finance here and we have agreed to find a
reliable foreign partner to deal with us although due to his position he
did not want to take active part but as soon as you follow myinstructions
everything will be successful because we will be working hand in hand wit=
h
him.

We thus propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin o=
f
these funds from the deceased and after due legal processes have been
followed the fund will be released to your account without delay and we
will use it for investment and to assist the less privileged in the
society.This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund
is legitimate and does not originate from drug, money laundry,
terrorism or any other illegal act. On receipt of your response I will
furnish you with detailed clarification as it relates to this mutual
benefit transaction look forward to hearing from you as soon as possible
if you are interested.

Regards,
Mr.Jim Nelson.
