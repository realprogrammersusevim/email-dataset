 of mutual benefit.

with the Shell Petroleum Development Company until his death in an ill fa=
ted plane crash UTA Flight 141 on Thursday 25th December, 2003 in Cotonou=
 along the coast of West Africa, had a balance of USD$27.5million with Un=

To this regard, I am contacting you being the lawyer to the deceased as I=
 have been directed by the Board of Trustees of the deceased bank to look=
 for the deceased next of kin, which I have done and found out that he ha=
s no next of kin which means that these funds will be lost to the governm=
ent.
 
In order to avert this development, I seek your indulgence to have you st=
and as the deceased next of kin so that the funds will be subsequently tr=
ansferred and paid into your foreign account. On indicating your interest=

l be allowed to retain 40% of the total amount after the transaction. If =
