FROM DR USMAN IBRAHIM DANKO.AUDITING AND ACCOUNTING UNIT.FOREIGN OPERATIONS=
 DEPARTMENT.BANQUE TOGOLAISE POUR LE COMMERCE ET L'INDUSTRIE,LOME- TOGO.=20

Dear Friend,             I do not intend to cause any grief to you. The rea=
son for sending this mail is very fundamental to the doctrine of human priv=
ileges and right. My name is Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko  I am quite convicned o=
f the fact that this will come to you as a surprise.however I am writing ba=
sed on the privlage information I garthered about you in internet during my=
 extensive search for a repose foreign partner who is compitent of assistin=
g me in below business proposal. I am the principal manager controlling the=
 auditing and accounting section of Banque Togolaise Pour Le Commerce Et L'=
Inustrie Lome Togo. in West Africa with due respect and regard.=20
=20
I have decided to contact you on a business transaction that will be very b=
eneficial to both of us at the end of the transaction. During our investiga=
tion and auditing in this bank, my department came across a very huge sum o=
f money belonging to a deceased person Mr Wahid Yoffe who died in the horri=
fic Asian tsunamis of Dec. 26, 2004, that has killed more than all 20th- ce=
ntury tsunamis combined that happened in Sumatra island, Indonesia.=20
=20
>From the information that our bank have gotten so far, the Tsunami killed h=
im with his entire family and no none relation have been identified. The pe=
rson that he used as his next of kin was his first son of 25 years old who =
died along side with the entire family. Although personally, I keep this in=
formation secret within myself and partner to enable the whole plans and id=
ea be Profitable and successful during the time of execution. The said amou=
nt was (US$11.4M).=20
=20
Meanwhile all the whole arrangement to put claim over this fund as the bona=
fide next of kin to the deceased, get the required approval and transfer th=
is money to a foreign account has been put in place and directives and need=
ed information will be relayed to you as soon as you indicate your interest=
 and willingness to assist us and also benefit your self to this great busi=
ness opportunity that comes once in life. In fact I could have done this de=
al alone but because of my position in this country as a civil servant, we =
are not allowed to perate a foreign account and would eventually raise an e=
ye brow on my side during the time of transfer because I work in this bank.=
=20
=20
This is the actual reason why it will require a second party or fellow who =
will forward claims as the next of kin with affidavit of trust of oath to t=
he Bank and also resent a foreign account where he will need the money to b=
e re-transferred in to on his request as it may be after due verification a=
nd clarification by the correspondent branch of the bank where the whole mo=
ney will be remitted from to your own designation bank account.=20
=20
May I at this point emphasize that this transaction is 100% risk free as I =
have made arrangements for a successful deal before contacting you. On smoo=
th conclusion of this transaction, you will be entitled to 30% of the total=
 sum as gratification, while 5% will be set aside to take care of expenses =
that may arise during the time of transfer processing and also telephone bi=
lls, while 65% will be for me and my partner.=20
=20
Please, you have been adviced to keep top secret as we are still in service=
 and intend to retire from service after we conclude this deal with you. I =
will be monitoring the whole situation here in this bank until you confirm =
the money in your account and ask us to come down to your country for subse=
quent sharing of the fund according to percentages previously indicated and=
 further investment, either in your country or any country you advice us to=
 invest in.=20
=20
All other necessary information will be sent to you when I hear from you. I=
 suggest you get back to me as soon as possible stating your wish in this d=
eal.
 Yours Sincerely, Dr Usman Ibrahim Danko.
