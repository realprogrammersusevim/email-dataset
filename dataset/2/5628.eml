My name is John paul, a member of Independent Committee of=20
Eminent Persons (ICEP), Switzerland. ICEP is charged with the responsibil=
ity=20
of finding bank accounts in Switzerland belonging to non-Swiss=20
indigenes, which have remained dormant since World War II.=20

It may interest you to know that in July of 1997, the Swiss Banker's=20
Association published a list of dormant accounts originally opened by=20
non-Swiss citizens. These accounts had been dormant since the end of Worl=
d=20
War II (May 9, 1945). Most belonged to Holocaust victims.

The continuing efforts of the Independent Committee of Eminent Persons=20
(ICEP) have since resulted in the discovery of additional dormant=20
accounts - 54,000 in December, 1999.

The published lists contain all types of dormant accounts, including=20
interest-bearing savings accounts, securities accounts, safe deposit=20
boxes, custody accounts, and non-interest-bearing transaction accounts.=20
Numbered accounts are also included. Interest is paid on accounts that=20
were interest bearing when established.

The Claims Resolution Tribunal (CRT) handles processing of all claims=20
on accounts due non-Swiss citizens. A dormant account of ORDNER ADELE=20
with a credit balance of 35,000,000 US dollar plus  accumulated interest=20
was discovered by me. The beneficiary was murdered during the holocaust=20
era, leaving no WILL and no possible records for trace of heirs.=20

The Claims Resolution Tribunal has been mandated to report all=20
unclaimed funds for permanent closure of accounts and transfer of existin=
g=20
credit balance into the treasury of Switzerland government as provided by=
=20
the law for management of assets of deceased beneficiaries who died=20
interstate (living no wills).

Being a top executive at ICEP, I have all secret details and necessary=20
contacts for claim of the funds without any hitch. The funds will be=20
banked in the Cayman Island, being a tax free, safe haven for funds and=20
we can share the funds and use in investment of our choice.

Due to the sensitive nature of my job, I need a foreigner to HELP claim=20
the funds. All that is required is for you to provide me with your=20
details for processing of the necessary legal and administrative claim=20
documents for transfer of the funds to you.

Kindly provide me with your full name, address, and telephone/fax. I=20
will pay all required fees to ensure that the fund is transferred to a=20
secure, numbered account in your name in the Cayman Island, of which you=20
will be capable of accessing the funds gradually and transferring to=20
your country and other banks of choice in the world. My share will be 60=20
percent and your share is 40 per cent of the total amount. THERE IS NO=20
