<P></P>
<P>It is my warmest pleasure in drawing your attention to this confidential=
 business proposal, having in mind that your positive response to this mail=
 will bring about success and interest to both parties involved. So I pray =
that you give this proposal some consideration</P>
<P></P>
<P>I am <B>Mr.tony reid</B>, the Vault manager of <B>Capital Trust Deposit =
UK</B>, one of the best of its kind, where most of our clients deposit thei=
r valuables such as money, diamond, gold etc. I have been with this company=
 for the past 10 years now so I am conversant with everything that goes on =
in it. Presently, there are some consignments deposited by various people f=
or the past 6 years with nobody coming for them or paying for their demurra=
ge. I carried out a private investigation and found out that most of them a=
re dead and there are no traces of any member of their families.</P>
<P>To me this is an opportunity to make money because am a businessman who =
believe that only my family should come before my business. Hence I have de=
cided to seek your assistance in this lucrative but profitable transaction.=
 I need you to present yourself as the beneficiary of one late<B> Mr. Abram=
 abbas</B>, a Jewish man who owns two of such consignments deposited with u=
s. If you accept this offer, all the relevant documents will be prepared in=
 your name with the assistance of some of my colleagues for the consignment=
 to be transferred to your country of residence. After which I will come ov=
er to meet you so we can then share the valuables in these boxes and as wel=
l discuss business. The net worth of the contents inside each of these boxe=
s is $12,000,000 (twelve million United States dollars).</P>
<P>I will be willing to give to you 30% of the total sum upon the completio=
n of the transaction if only you indicate your interest. I assure you that =
you will not be subjected to any form of illegality, as far as you work han=
d to hand with me on this.</P>
<P>I hope to further strengthen my business relationship with you after the=
 execution of this one. I strongly believe that for the sake of God, you wi=
ll exhibit a trust worthy character when you receive these funds. Keep this=
 transaction confidential, for the sake of my job. Hear from you soon.</P>
