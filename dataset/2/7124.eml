Before he finally gave up in the hospital,he made me to understand that he deposited the total sum of Five million, Five
hundred thousand United State Dollars in a nearby country with a security firm and After his death, i was able to locate the documents relating to that deposit with the security company.

I have tried with all possibility to claim this consignment funds from the cargo company but following the principles and procedures of the diplomatic company that i must provide the next of kin to that deposit with the deposit certificate.

I want to be assure of any safe hand and your honesty to assist me as the next of kin to this deposit and then after by sending your Particulars to enable me start off with all the shipping arrangement and forwarding it to the company while you stand for the release of the consignment as the beneficiary, more also, this transaction is 100% risk free since I have the legal document covering this deposit which shall be forwarded to you
