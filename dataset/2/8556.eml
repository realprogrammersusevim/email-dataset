Dear Friend,


 My name is DR,IDRIS BELLO, a member of the Presidential 
Task Force on Oil Spillage Clean-up.
 Early last year there was a major oil spillage in 
the Niger Delta Region of Nigeria which rendered over 70% 
of the communities homeless.
 A contract was awarded to a foreign firm to 
rehabilitate the communitties, because of the huge monetary 
profit I envisaged, we decided to over-invoice the contract 
sum.

 Now the contract has been completed and the original 
contractor has long been paid,but the contract
 balance of THIRTY EIGHT MILLION UNITED STATES DOLLARS
(US$38 MILLION),which resulted from the over invoiced
 contract sum has been left in a suspense account with the 
DEBT RECONCILIATION COMMITTEE,A SUBSIDIARY OF OUR APEX BANK,
 This over invoice sum is what we intend to take out of 
the country for ourselves.

The problem is as government officials,we are not suppose 
to own fat bank accounts,talk less of having foreign ones.
 To this end, we are soliciting your assistance as a 
foreign partner who can assist us and receive this amount 
into your account.

 We are ready to share this money with you on the basis 
of participation.
we also have plans to invest part of this money in any 
viable business in your country under your care,as we are 
nearing our retirement age.

 In any case, I received a reference of you/organization 
from the Nigeria Chambers of Commerce and Industry =91Foreign 
Trade Division=92as a reputable organ that can assist us on 
this transaction.

 Please if you accept my proposal do not hesitate to reply 
to me on my e-mail:(bello_dd@doctor.com)or
(obilolo@netscape.net) so that I can provide you with the 
basic procedures for the release of the fund. 

 It does not matter whether you or your company does 
contract project of the nature described here, the 
assumption is that you won a major contract and 
subcontracted it to another company, more often than
not, big trading companies or individuals of unrelated 
field win major contracts here in Nigeria and subcontracts 
same to more specialized 
firms for execution.

 The BENEFIT For providing the account where we shall remit 
this money, you will be entitled to 25% of the entire 
funds, 70% will be for me and my partners,while 5% has been 
set aside to cover any expenses that
may be incurred by both parties during this transaction, 
both local and international.

 Please I enjoin you to handle this transaction with utmost 
degree of maturity and confidentiality because 

I am still in active government service with the NIGERIAN 
NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION.

If I receive your response on time, this whole transaction 
could be accomplished within the shortest possible time 
based on your interest and determination,since the money is 
already on transit.

 Please, try to call me up to confirm the receipt of this e-
mail on my confidential TEL/FAX: 234 1 759 0379.
 The lines may be busy,but keep trying till you get 
through. 

Yours faithfully, 

DR,IDRIS BELLO.. 
 
 NOTE:ALWAYS ENDEVOUR TO SEND YOUR MAIL THROUGH THIS TWO
