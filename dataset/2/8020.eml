Dear Sir/Madam

My name is MR PETER MOYO, the eldeset son of Mr.MORGAN MOYO of Zimbabwe. 
This might come to you as a surprise about where I got your contact address. 
I got your address from the South African Chamber of Commerce in 
Johannesburg, South Africa.

During the current war against the farmers in Zimbabwe from the supporters 
of our President Robert Mugabe to claim all the white-owned farms to his 
party members and his followers, he ordered all white farmers to surrender 
all their farms to his party members and his followers.
Myfather was one of the best farmers in our country and because he did not 
support Mugabe's ideas, Mugabe's supporters invaded my father's farm and 
burnt everything in the farm, killing my father and made away with a lot of 
items in my father's farm.

Before his death, my father had deposited with one of the Security Company 
in Johannesburg, South Africa the sum of US$26 Million United States 
Dollars).with my name and made every documents with my name both the 
certificate of depository. Then after the death of my father, we decided to 
move to the Republic of South Africa
where he had deposited the money in the Security Company as family 
valuables.

So, I decided to contact you to assist me to transfer this money out of 
South Africa because as asylum seekers we are not allowed to operate any 
bank account within South Africa. We have agreed to offer you 20% of the 
total sum for your assistance, 5% will be mapped out for any expenses that 
may be incurred in the course of this transaction and 75% will be for me and 
my family to invest in your country.

All I want you to do is to furnish me with your full personal phone and fax 
numbers for easy communication. You can contact me on the above Telephone 
number. Note that this transaction is 100% risk free and absolutely 
confidential.

Thanks and God bless as I await your reply.
Best Regards,
PETER MOYO
(For Family).
