FROM THE DESK OF: DR JUBRIL  IBRAHIM
AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK (ADB)
BILL AND EXCHANGE DEPARTMENT,
OFFSHORE OFFICE, OUAGADOUGOU,
BURKINA-FASO.


ATTN PLS:

My Name is Dr. Jubril Ibrahim, I am the Bill and Exchange (assistant) 
Manager of the Africa    development Bank here in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. 
In my department i discovered an abandoned funds (USD$ 11.3million) in an 
account that belongs to one of our foreign customer (MR.ABDUL RASAQ HASIN, 
Jordan) who died along with his entire family in July 2000 in a plane crash.

               http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/859479.stm

Since i got information about his death, I have been expecting his next of 
kin to come over and claim his money because we cannot release it unless 
some body applies for it as next of kin or relation to the deceased as 
indicated in our banking guidelines and laws but unfortunately we learnt 
that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside with him at the 
plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim.

It is therefore upon this discovery that I now decided to make this business 
proposal to you and release the money to you as the next of kin or relation 
to the deceased for safety and subsequent disbursement since nobody is 
coming for it and we don't want this money to go into the bank treasury as 
unclaimed bill.

The banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained 
unclaimed after Six years, the money will be transferred into the bank 
treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next of kin in this 
business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a foreigner and an 
Indigene cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner.

Your percentage will be declared to you as soon as you indicate your 
interest. I will visit your country for disbursement according to the 
percentage indicated once you have agreed to get this fund transferred 
through your account.

Therefore, to enable the immediate move of this fund to you arranged, you 
must apply first to the bank as relation or next of kin of the deceased 
indicating.

1. Your full name and address
2. Your telephone and fax number for easy communication.
3. Your company's name and address.

Upon receipt of your reply, I will send to you by fax or email the text of 
the application.

I will not fail to bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch-free 
and that you should not entertain any atom of fear as all required 
arrangements have been made for the movement of the money.

You should contact me immediately as soon as you receive this letter. 
Trusting to hear from you immediately. Reply through my alternative Email:

Yours Faithfully,

Dr.Jubril Ibrahim.
