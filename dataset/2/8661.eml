defuct Republican Guard of ousted President Saddam Hussein . During the hay =
days of ex-president Saddam rulership in iraq my late husband was head of =
secret Army's procurement unit of the Republican Guard. His position and =
resposibility  availed him with so much power and financial liquidity that he =
was able to amass substantial amount of money some of which he wisely move to =
secret custody  out side iraq. Having forseen the caputilation of Saddam =
Hussein government my late husband quietly moved his family (my two kids & I) =
to Europe and tried to desert the Iraqi Army to join us in Europe, but was =
cought up  with by the dangerosu secret security mechinary  of Saddam. He was =

London here.

It is true that i have never known you but i am desprately in need of =
somebody to trust, it has become a matter of expediency and total surrended =
to the will of God , the Almighty.

business profile including all contact details for us to move forward without =
delay. You can reach me direclt on my fax +447092041337.
