MR. PETER LANG=20
Postfach, 3001 Bern Switzerland=20

IMPERATIVE AND PRIVATE.

 I am contacting you on business transfer of a huge sum of money from a d=
eceased account. Though I know that a transaction of this magnitude will =
make any one apprehensive and worried, but I am assuring you that all wil=
l be well at the end of the day. We decided to contact you due to the urg=
ency of this transaction. PROPOSITION; We discovered an abandoned sum of =
US$7,500,000.00 (Seven Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollar=
s) in an account that belongs to one of our foreign customers who died al=
ong with his entire family. Since his death, none of his next-of-kin or r=
elations has come forward to lay claims for this money as the heir. We ca=
nnot release the fund from his account unless someone applies for claim a=
s the next-of-kin to the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines.=
 Upon this discovery, we now seek your permission to have you stand as a =
next of kin to the deceased as all documentations will be carefully worke=
d out by us for the funds (US$7,500,000.00) to be released in your favour=
 as the beneficiary's next of kin. It may interest you to know that we ha=
ve secured from the probate an order of madamus to locate any of deceased=
 beneficiaries. Please acknowledge receipt of this message in acceptance =
of our mutual business endeavour by furnishing me with the following; 1. =
Your name and address 2. Direct Telephone and fax numbers These requireme=
nts will enable us file letter of claim to the appropriate departments fo=
r necessary approvals in your favour before the transfer can be made. We =
shall be compensating you with a million dollars on final conclusion of t=
his project, while the rest shall be for us. If this proposal is acceptab=
le by you, please response immediately,
I await your urgent response.=20
Regards,
Mr. Peter Lang=20
