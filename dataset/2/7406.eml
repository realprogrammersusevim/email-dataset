                  {Very Urgent Business Transaction} 
Dear , 

In order 
to transfer out (Thirty Two Million Three Hundred & Fifty Thousand 
Dollars) from our bank here , I have the courage to look for a reliable 
and honest person who will be capable for this important transaction, 
believing that you will never let me down either now or in future. I am 
Mr. Frank Lanker the auditor and head of computing department of a bank 
here in London, United Kingdom. 

I am the chief personal account to 
one Mr. Rafik Hariri who died on February 14, 2005 You can log on to 
this website: www.hariri.info, Mr. Rafik Hariri who was a Lebanese and 
the manager of Petrochemical service here in London, a chemical 
engineer by profession .And then, nobody knows about this account or 
anything concerning it.

I am only contacting you as a foreigner 
because this money can not be approved to any local bank here in 
London, but can only be approved to any foreign account because the 
money is United State Dollars? And the former owner of the account was 
Mr. Rafik Hariri and he was a foreigner too. Finally, at the conclusion 
of this business, you will be given 35% of the total amount,60% will be 
for me ,while 5% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred 
during the process of this transaction. 

Yours Sincerely,

Dr. 
Kingsley William Mark .
