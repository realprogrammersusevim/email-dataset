Dear Sir,

Let me first apologise to you for any mbarrassment
this mail might cause you.
I am MAHOYI BELLO, a cousin to the Vice Presidentof
the Federal Republic of Nigeria (Alhaji Atiku) and
Executive Director of SADIQ PETROLUEM LTD.I have
decided to contact you for this business proposal
based on the mutual understanding I know that can
exist between us, having known that people of your
Country are trustworthy.

Since May 1999 when the new Government came to
power,large sums of money have been recovered from our
past military leaders who siphoned money from Nigeria
and deposited it in offshore accounts in
Europe,America,Asia and some parts of Africa, for
their own selfish benefits. This happened during the
military regime,Now we are under a democratically
elected government. This fund was among the money
recovered and seized by the Federal Government of
Nigeria. 

Hence, my elder cousin (Alhaji Atiku Abubakar) the
Vice-President of Nigeria is in charge of all
off-shore accounts seized and retrieved from our past
military leaders.Therefore, we urged you to assist us
provide a very vital offshore account, where the sum
of US$25,000,000.00 (Twenty Five Million) US Dollars
will be transferred for safe keeping. 

Presently, this money is in a foreign Country I cannot
mention now.Please note that other information will be
detailed to you on the receipt of your reply. My
elder cousin and I have agreed to give you (the
account owner)for this transaction 30% of the total
amount remitted while 60%is for me and Cousin Atiku,
for the purchase of foreign investments, with your
assistance after the money have been disbursed, while
10% is for expenses both of us will incur.

Note, I have been mandated by my elder cousin to
handle this deal with you, due to his position in the
Nigerian Government as the second citizen. Therefore,
if my proposal satisfies you, kindly contact me via my
e-mail address and enclose your phone and fax numbers
for urgent confidential discussion.Your letter of
acceptance indicating your personal telephone and fax
numbers to enable us move ahead.

Besides, this transaction is risk-free and hoped to
last 7 (seven) banking days upon my elder cousin
Alhaji Atiku Abubakar's authorisation.I thank you for
your expected co-operation. 

God Bless you.Best Regards.

MAHOYI BELLO.
