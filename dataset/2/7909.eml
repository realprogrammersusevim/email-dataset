 A UK citizen, Mr=2E Norman Anderson (from Aberdeen) has been a custome=

er 15, 1999=2E I have been the account owner=92s confidant and account =
officer until above date when he was last seen in the bank=2E And since=
 this time Mr=2E Anderson has not been to the bank nor sent in cheque f=
or clearing=2E This became a source of worry to me and prompted my pers=
onal investigation as to whereabouts and business activity of this cust=
omer=2E Result of my investigation revealed that he was into oil bunker=
ing and operated within West and Central Africa sub-regions=2E Further =
investigation proved that he was one of the victims of November 1999 ra=
id of illegal oil bunkering merchants in Malabo Island of Equatorial Gu=
inea=2E However, I continued my investigation and further discovered th=
at a UK telephone number mentioned in our bank information form, which =
he filled when the said bank account was established, belong to a hotel=
 in London=2E This is a clear indication that he probably has fed my ba=
nk with false information to protect his illegal oil deals=2E I have no=

 After a careful study of the account file and available data to me, I =
have packaged a good deal as follows; and will wish to carry it out wit=

t submission to the bank=2E With my position as the foreign operations =
manager we will quietly remove this money from the bank without hitches=
=2E I don=92t have any problem in regularizing all necessary documents =
and transferring the credit balance of the said account to your nominat=
ed bank account in overseas, but the problem is trust=2E I have spent m=
onths in trying to get an overseas reliable contact=2E It is worthy to =

ng lies=2E=20
 On this ground I request your unreserved but sincere cooperation devoi=
d of greed in carrying out this transaction so that no one amongst both=
