A La Carte Research recruits for Focus Groups across the country.  Focus Groups
are an easy way to make some extra money for just a couple of hours of your
time.  Each group is only for the purpose of learning your opinions.  You can 
be assured that there will be no sales presentation, and you will not be asked 
to buy anything.  Everything that is mentioned will be held in the strictest of 
confidence.  Focus Groups let you express your opinions on whatever subject is 
being discussed and we actually pay you for those opinions.

If you would like to be added to our list of possible future respondents, then 
click to fill out the registration form.  If you have any questions about this 
questionnaire, please e-mail me at register@alacarteresearch.com

Sincerely,
John Mooney
