Dearest=2C

I am Chief Thomas Nimely yaya=2C chairman of the Movement for 
Democracy in Liberia =28MODEL=29=2Cnow Foreign Minister in the transitional 
government=2C and also a first cousin to the deposed President 
of Liberia=2C Charles Taylor=2C who is presently in exile in one of the 
West African Countries=2E

 During the reign of my cousin=2C Charles Taylor=2C I was
in-charge of all Diamond operations coming from
Angola=2C Sierra Leone=2C etc=2E  Then Charles Taylor enjoyed
the patronage of the rebels controlling parts of 
these countries=2C as tonnes of uncut diamond were
shipped to him=2C and he inturn through me sold these
diamonds to foreigners=2C and used the proceeds to buy
arms for the rebels in these countries=2C and a large
chunk of this money  was for the enrichment of the
rebel leaders=2E Literally speaking he  gave cover to the
rebel Leaders=2E This operation was code named=3A Conflict
Diamond=2E I cordinated the entire Diamond trade in the
sub-region and this ran into hundreds of Million of
Dollar=2E

While carrying out this operation=2C I was able to divert
the sum of US$45=2C000=2C000=2E00 =28Forty-Five Million
United States Dollars=29 for my personal benefit=2C and
it is concelled into 4 Trunk Boxes and deposited as
artifacts materials with ecowas diplomatic Security and cargo unit 
 in Accra-Ghana=2E 

The Security Company does not know the
true contents of the consignments=2E This is only known to you and 
me=2C and I hope you will keep this confidential=2E

Now that Charles Taylor is no more in Power=2C I thought
it wise to move the money out to any  country of the
world for investment purposes=2E Now I am contacting you
seeking your assistance to help me in transfering this
money to your country=2E All you need do is to make
necesary arrangement and fly down to Accra-Ghana=2C see the
money and talk about it=2E

Already=2C I have the consent of the Security Company Director in Accra-Ghana
who has agreed to help us move the consignments out through
Diplomatic means to their affilliate office in Europe=2E 

I am offering you 25% of the total amount involved for
assisting me while 5% is set aside for any expenses that might be incurred during
the completion of this project=2C and the remaining 70% will be used for any lucrative
investment you will introduce me into=2E



Best Regards=2C
