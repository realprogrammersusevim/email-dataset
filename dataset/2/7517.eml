THOUSAND DOLLARS)

We want to transfer to overseas the sum of($39,500.000.00USD) Thirty Nine
Million Five Hundred Thousand United States Dollars)from a Prime Bank in 
Africa. I would like to ask you to quietly look for a reliable and honest 
person who will be capable and fit to provide eitheran existing bank account 
or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this money, even an empty 
a/c can serve as far as it can receive money.

I am Mr IBRAHIM MUSTAPHA an accountant and personal confidant to Dr. 
Ravindra F. Shah who died together with his wife Dr.Mrs.Manjula Parikh-Shah 
in a plane crash on the 1st Oct. 2003 on their way to attend wedding in 
Boston. Mr. Ravindra F. Shah, is an American, a physician and industrialist, 
he died without having any beneficiary to his assets including his account 
here in Burkina Faso which he opened in the year 2000 as his personal 
savings for the purpose of expansion and developement of his
company before his untimely death in 2003.The amount involved 
i(USD39,500,000.00)ThirtyNine Million Five Hundred Thousand USD, no other 
person knows about this
account. I am contacting you for us to transfer this funds to your account 
as the
beneficiary, I want to first transfer $9,500.000.00 (Nine Million 
FiveHundred Thousand USD) from this money into a safe account abroad, after 
which we will transfer the
remaining (30M)but I don't know any foreigner. I amonly contacting you as a 
foreigner because this money can not be approved to a local person 
here,without valid international foreign passport, but can only be approved 
to any foreigner with valid international passport ordrivers license and 
foreign a/c because the money is in US Dollars and
the former owner of the a/c Mr.Ravindra F. Shah is a foreigner too, and as 
such the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account, which I will give to you, upon your positive 
response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with 
the inheritance procedures.

At the conclusion of this business, you will begiven 35% of the total 
amount,60% will be for me, while 5% will be forexpenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring You should observe utmost 
CONFIDENTIALITYANDSECRECY in this transaction, and rest assured that this 
transaction would be mostprofitable for both of us because I will require 
your assistance to investmy share in your country.
