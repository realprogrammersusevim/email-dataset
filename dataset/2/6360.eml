The deceased had a deposit with HSBC Bank of London, valued presently at
15million pounds Sterling which he did not disclose to anybody not even
his own wife because three days before he made this deposit, he caught his
wife cheating and they both  divorced before his sudden death.

Now, I seek your consent to present you as the Next of kin/Will
Beneficiary to the deceased so that the proceeds of this account valued
at 15 Million pounds  can be paid to you.  This will be disbursed or
shared in these percentages, 60% to me and 30% to you and 10% for charity
organizations.



All necessary legal documents that can be used to back up your claim as
the will beneficiary will be carefully worked out by me here in the
United Kingdom. All I require is your honest CO-OPERATION, CONFIDENTIALITY
and TRUST to enable us see this transaction through.

I guarantee you that this will be executed under a legitimate arrangement
that will protect you from any breach of the law. Please get in touch with
me urgently by E-mail: kenshaw@katamail.com
with the following information below:

1. Your Full Name.
2. Your Telephone Number and Fax Number.
3. Your Contact Address.

This is to enable me commence immediate preparation of all legal documents
that you will use to apply to HSBC bank for the release and subsequent
transfer of the 15 Million pounds sterling into your account.

Your urgent response will be highly anticipated and appreciated.

Best Regards,

Barr. Ken Shaw.
