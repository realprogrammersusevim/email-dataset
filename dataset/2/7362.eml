Dear, May the blessing of God be upon you and grant you the wisdom and sympathy to understand my situation and how much I need your help.

I am writing to express my interest in real estate or landed properties in your country. Though my father died in detention a couple of months ago while been detained by the new government. Before his untimely death, he instructed me to leave the country for my safety and start up a business somewhere out side Africa. The sum of (9.000.000 million ) US dollars was deposited in a security and finance company here in Dakar Senegal by my late father.Actually, I have never met you before, it was a friend of my father who happened to be present at his bural that adviced me to consider your country for my investments. After due consideration, I started searching the web side where I got your email address.
 No one else is aware of my proposal to you. Due to social, economic and political in stability in west African region, I decided to seek your assistance in transfering this money into your private or institutional account for investment purposes.
