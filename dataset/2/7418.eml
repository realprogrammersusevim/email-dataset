transfer of ($ 25,200.000.00) twenty five million, two hundred
thousand dollars

I am mr Ibrahim Rashid, the auditor general of african development bank
here
in burkina faso. during the course of our auditing; i discovered a
floating
fund in an account opened in the bank by mr john korovo,  after going
through some old files in the records i discovered that the owner of
the
account died in  the (Beirut-bound charter jet) plane crash on the 25th
december 2003 in cotonou (republic of Benin). here is
the(website=http://www.cnn.com/2003/world/africa/12/26/benin.crash/index.html).and
since then nobody has operated on this account again,

the owner of this account is mr john korovo a foreigner, and a trader
who
trade on gold and mining and he died, since 2003 and no other person
knows
about this account or any thing concerning it, the account has no other
beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well that mr john
korovo
die along with his entire family.

the amount involved is ($ 25.2 m) twenty-five million, two hundred
thousand
united states dollars only , i am only contacting you as a foreigner
because
this money can not be approved to a local person here, with valid
international foreign passport, but can only be approved to any
foreigner
with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign
account
because the money is in us dollars and the former owner of the account
mr
john korovo is a foreigner too, and the money can only be approved into
a
foreign account.

i need your strong assurance that you will never, never cheat me as
soon as
this fund hit into your account. with my influence and the position of
the
bank official we can transfer this money to any foreigner's reliable
account
which you can provide with assurance that this money will be intact
pending
our physical arrival in your country for sharing. the bank official
will
prove all documents of transaction immediately for you to receive this
fund
leaving no trace to any place and to build confidence.

i will apply for annual leave to get visa immediately i hear from you
that
you are ready receive this fund in your account .at the conclusion of
this
business, you will be given 30% of the total amount, 60% will be for
me,
while 10% will be for expenses both parties might have incurred during
the
process of transferring.
