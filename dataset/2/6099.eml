Sir, 
ASSISTANCE REQUIRED FOR ACQUISITION OF ESTATE 

I have been detailed by the Director Audit / Accounts Allocations Department Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources, Dr. John Akiga and other colleagues to write and inform you of our desire to acquire estates or landed properties in your country with funds currently trapped at our Accounts with the Central bank of Nigeria (CBN) 

Considering his very strategic and influential position, he would want the transaction to be as strictly confidential as possible. He would further 
want our identity and yours to remain undisclosed outside this circle at least for now, untill the completion of the transaction. We desire to have an overseas agent in order to make a smooth transfer without hitch. 

I therefore take this opportunity to inquire if you would agree to act as our overseas agent in order to actualize this transaction. 

The deal, in brief, is that the funds with which we intend to carry out our proposed investments in your country is presently in a coded account 
at the Nigerian Apex Bank (i.e. the Central Bank of Nigeria) and we need your assistance to transfer the funds to your country in a convenient bank 
account that will be provided by you before we can put the funds into use in your country. For this, you shall be considered to have executed a contract 
for the Federal Ministry of Petroleum Resources in Nigeria for which payment should be effected to you by the Ministry, The contract sum shall be US$17.4 Million, of which your share shall be 20% if you agree to be our overseas agent. 

As soon as payment is effected, and the amount mentioned above is successfully transferred into your account, we intend to use our own share in acquiring some estates abroad. For this, you shall be expected to serve as our agent in the acquisition of this properties and purchase of shares / Bonds. In the light of this, I would like you to forward to me the following information: 

1.Your company name and address if any (Personal) 
2.Your personal fax number 
3.Your personal telephone number for easy communication. 
You are requested to communicate your acceptance of this proposal through my above stated FAX NUMBER / PHONE / email address after which we shall discuss in details the modalities necessary to see this transaction through. 

Your quick response will be highly appreciated. Thank you in anticipation of your cooperation. 

Yours faithfully, 

Barrister Peter Umeh. FAX: (private) 234-1-7591936
