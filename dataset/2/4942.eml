ent Of The Season, <BR><BR>On a very good day. I am (jerry kabore&nbsp;Es=
q),The Head of file Department in African developent bank (ADB).I got you=
r contact from Yahoo tourist search.<BR><BR>When i was searching for a fo=
reign partner i assured of your capability and reliability to champion th=
is businees opportunity when i prayed to God or
  Allah about you.In my department we discovered an abandoned sum of $ 15=
 million U.S.A dollars ( fifteen million U.S.A dollars) . In an account t=
hat belongs to one of our foreign customer who died along with his entire=
 family in <FONT color=3D#bf00bf><U>(Monday 31st July 2000)</U></FONT> in=
 a plane crash. Since we got information about his death, we have been ex=
pecting his next of kin to come over and claim his money because we canno=
t release it unless somebody applies for it as next of kin or relation to=
 the deceased as indicated in our banking guidelines, but unfortunately w=
e learnt that all his supposed next of kin or relation died alongside wit=
h him at the plane crash leaving nobody behind for the claim. It is there=
fore upon this discovery that I and one official in my department now dec=
ided to make this businness proposal to you and release the money to you =
as the next of kin or relation to the deceased for safety and subsequent =
disbursement since nobody is coming for it=20
 and we don=92t want this money to go into the bank treasury as unclaimed=
 bill.<BR><BR>The Banking law and guideline here stipulates that if such =
money remained unclamed after five years, the money will be transfered in=
to the Bank treasury as unclaimed fund. The request of foreigner as next =
of kin in this business is occasioned by the fact that the customer was a=
 foreigner, and a Burkinabe cannot stand as next of kin to a foreigner. W=
e agree that 30 % of this money will be for you as foreign partner, in re=
spect to the provision of a foreign account, 10 % will be set aside for e=
xpenses incured during the business and 60 % would be for me and my woman=
 colleague. There after i will visit your country for disbursement accord=
ing to the percentages indicated. <BR><BR>Therefore to enable the immedia=
te trnansfer of this fund to you as arranged, you must apply first to the=
 bank as relations or next of kin of the deceased indicating your bank na=
me, your bank account number, your private=20
 telephone and fax number for easy and effective communication and locati=
on where the money will be remitted.Upon receipt of your reply, I will se=
nd to you by fax or email the text of the application I will not fail to =
bring to your notice that this transaction is hitch free and that you sho=
uld not entertain any atom of fear as all required arrangements have been=
 made for thetransfer. <BR><BR>You should contact me on my number <FONT c=
