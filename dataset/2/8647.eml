Dear Friend ,

I am Barrister Peter Brown a member of Nigeria Bar
Association (NBA).Your contact reached me through the
World Business Encyclopaedia.Hence,I made up my mind to
introduce this business to you in confidence for the
mutual benefit of both of us.

The sum of USD45M (Forty five Million United States)
was lodged into a security company here in the Country
by the late Head of State (GEN.SANI ABACHA) for
safe-keeping. This money was lodged in security vaults
/ boxes and labelled as personal belongings and as such
the security company does not know the true content of
the boxes.This money was originally meant to be used
for his political campaign. Because I was his family
Attorney as such he confided in me with the
relevant document papers relating to this deposit
before he died of cardiac arrest.

As a matter of fact we have concluded all arrangement
with an offshore Security Company to move this money as
a consignment through diplomatic means to their
offshore affiliated office where you will be required
to put claim to the consignment as the bonafide
beneficiary of the consignment. You should know that
this business is safety and 100% risk-free as it
does not involve drug money or Terrorist fund.

If you are interested to carry out this transaction
with me, 20% will be for you for your assistance, 5%
for general expenses, and 75% for us.

You are required to send by e-mail immediately your

agreement that will guide and protect both of us in
this transaction also which will be used to
effect the change of ownership of the consignment to
your name as the beneficiary of the consignment.
