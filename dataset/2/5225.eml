Dear Sir

REPATRIATION OF $65.5M

Following the approvals received by this office recommending
for the immediate repatriation of the above referenced fund
and having been listed in category \"A\" foreign creditors,
you are by this notice informed that your assistance is
required in receiving the approved fund floating in an
offshore payments Account in Holland. This is as result of
grossly over invoiced contracts which were executed by a
(Deceased) national of Foreign country on the Oil Refineries
in Saudi Arabia.This contract was deliberately over invoiced
to the tune of US$65.5m Million Dollars. This was a deal by
my committee to enefit from the project.


I have therefore been mandated as a matter of trust to look
for a foreign partner into whose account we could transfer
the sum of USD65,500,000.00 (sixty-five million, five
hundred thousand Us Dollars only). We have agreed to share
the funds thus: 80% for us and 20% for account owner (you).
If you are interested, please forward the following
information to:

(1) Your Name/company\'s name and full address,
(2) Your banker\'s name, Swift code, address, A/C number,
telephone and
fax numbers.
(3) Your contact Tel/Fax No.
(4) Your Occupation
(5) Valid ID

Upon the receipt of the above details, payment will be
activated by the feeding of your data into payment system,
followed by a signal that will be sent to the paying bank to
remit funds into your nominated bank account within 7
official working days of receipt of the above
information. Your swift response will be highly appreciated.

Best regards

Smith Badwell
