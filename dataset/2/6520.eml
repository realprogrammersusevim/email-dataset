Dear Friend,

My name is SALIM IBRAHIM a merchant in Dubai, in the U.A.E.I have been 
diagnosed with Esophageal cancer It has defiled all forms of medical 
treatment, and right now I have only about a few months to live, according 
to medical experts.

I have not particularly lived my life so well, as I never really cared for 
anyone (not even myself) but my business. Though I am very rich, I was never 
generous, I was always hostile to people and only focused on my business as 
that was the only thing I cared for. But now I regret all this as I now know 
that there is more to life than just wanting to have or make all the money 
in the world.

I believe when God gives me a second chance to come to this world I would 
live my life a different way from how I have lived it. Now that God has 
called me, I have willed and given most of my property and assets to my 
immediate and extended family members as well as a few close friends.

I want God to be merciful to me and accept my soul so, I have decided to 
give also to charity organizations, as I want this to be one of the last 
good deeds I do on earth. So far, I have distributed money to some charity 
organizations in the U.A.E, Algeria and Malaysia. Now that my health has 
deteriorated so badly, I cannot do this myself anymore.

I once asked members of my family to close one of my accounts and distribute 
the money which I have there to charity organization in Bulgaria and 
Pakistan, they refused and kept the money to themselves. Hence, I do not 
trust them anymore, as they seem not to be contended with what I have left 
for them.

The last of my money which no one knows of is the huge

cash deposit of (Twenty million five hundred thousand u.s dollars)

that I have with a finance/Security Company abroad. I will want you to help 
me collect this consignment and dispatched it to charity organizations.

I have set aside 15% for you,then 5% for any expenses insured.

God be with you.

SALIM IBRAHIM

NOTE: please my friend, becuase of security reasons kindly

I WOULD APPRECIATE YOUR URGENT RESPONCE. THANKS ALOT,
MAY THE GOOD GOD BLESS YOU ABONDANTLY.
