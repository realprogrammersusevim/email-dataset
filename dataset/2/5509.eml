Dear Sir, 
My name is Venus Savimbi, the nephew of the late 
jonas savimbi the former leader of the UNITA rebel 
fighters in Angola. I am presently in Europe, where I 
intend to look for a credible business partner to 
assist my brother and I take physical pocession of a 
consignment of money, precisely US$25,500,000:00 
(Twenty five million five hundred thousand united 
states dollars) which my uncle kept under the custody 
of my father in a security company in Ghana. 

My parents was killed along with my uncle, and in his 
will he clearly stated that my brother and I should 
look for a credible individual who would assist us in 
investing these funds, as we are not conversant with 
investment procedures in the world business and we 
have never been in posession of such funds all our 
lives. For these reasons, he believes that the only 
way we can live without him is if we get someone very 
vast in the field of business and investment to help 
us claim the funds and invest it on our behalf, so we 
can further our educations, as well as living our 
lives the way he wants us to. 

My brother is in Ghana, looking after the money in the 
security company, and he has asked that I travel out 
to Europe to look for a foreign partner to assist us. 
I would furnish you with his telephone numbers as soon 
as I receive your response, so you can deal with him 
directly, as he has all the modalties for the release 
of the consignment. 

We have both decided that we would make available to 
you for your assistance, 15% of the total sum of money 
involved, but we have also decided to leave it open to 
negotiation. 

I would give you more details as soon as I hear from 
you. Till then I expect your prompt response. 

Yours faithfully 

VENUS SAVIMBI
