Augustin Soro.
Koffi & Soro Chamber,
Avocats et Conseils.
06 BP 1409 cocody,
Cote d'Ivorie -West Africa.

Attn;Dddddddd R. Rrrrr
   
  
I am Augustin Soro, an attorney at law. This mail is written to solicit your assistance to be presented as next of kin to my deceased client Mr Ronald Lake. He made a fixed deposit valued US 3.5M,(Three Million, Five Hundred Thousand US Dollars) on September 1998 for 36 months maturity, with an intent of putting up a gold mining company here in Cote d' Ivorie and upon the maturity this bank started contacting him but to no avail On 31 January, 2000, my clientele along with his wife died in a plane crash of Alaska Airlines Flight number 261. You shall read more about the crash
on visiting this site(http://www.cnn.com/2000/US/02/01/alaska.airlines.list/)
The Governing Body of the bank has contacted me on this matter, based on the fact that his supposed next of kin, happened to die in the said crash and I am yet
to provide any other Next of Kin to lay claim to the fund.

Under a clear and legitimate agreement with you, I shall seek your consent to be presented as the next of Kin,so that the proceeds of this account now valued US
4.1 million, will be paid to you, so that the Bank will not confiscate this fund, as the banking law and guidelines here stipulates that if such money remained unclaimed after four years, the money will be transfered into the bank treasury as unclaimed fund
For the sake of transparency on this matter, you are free to make immediate contact with me through my mailbox, for further information related to this matter.

Thank you very much for your anticipated acceptance while I expect your prompt response.

Yours faithfully,

  Barrister Augustin Soro
