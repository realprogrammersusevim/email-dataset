Zimbabwean opposition party rich farmers murdered by the agents of the ru=
ling
Government of president Robert mugabe, for his alleged support and sympat=
hy

ore
the death of my

father, he had taken to Johannesburg and deposited the sum of thirty eigh=
t
million united state dollars (U$38,000,000 with a diplomatic company in
South Africa, and transfer to NETHERLAND(EUROPE), as if he foreseen the
looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as valuable
items (photographic material) to avoid over taxed custom clearance. These=

land problems arose when president Robert mugabe introduced a new land ac=
t
that wholly affected the rich white farmers and some blacks vehemently co=
ndemned
the ideal. This result to rampant killings and mob action by the war vete=
rans
and some political thugs, precisely more than three thousand( 3,000) peop=

itain
and United States have voice their condemnation of Mugabe's plans. Subseq=
uently,
