t
million united state dollars (U$38,000,000 with a diplomatic company in
South Africa, and transfer to NETHERLAND(EUROPE), as if he foreseen the
looming danger in Zimbabwe. The money was deposited in a box as valuable
items (photographic material) to avoid over taxed custom clearance. These=

land problems arose when president Robert mugabe introduced a new land ac=
t
