Dear sir,

I am pleased to introduce a business opportunity to you,to transfer to your 
overseas account,sum of,(US$10.500.000m)Ten million five hundred thousands 
United States Dollars) from one of the Prime Banks here in Dakar-Senegal,I 
urgently want to know soonest you,If you are not capable to handle and 
acomodate this magnitude of funds untill i resign and come over to join for 
an investment in your country,tell me so that i can quietly look for another 
reliable and honest individual/organisation that would be capable and fit 
enough to provide either an existing bank account
or to set up a new Bank a/c immediately to receive this funds,even an empty 
a/c can serve to receive
this funds,as long as you will remain honest to me till we actualise this 
interest,believing that you will never let me down either now or in future.

I am Mr Mona Noah the Auditor General of one of the prime banks here in 
Dakar Senegal west Africa during the course of our auditing,I discovered a 
floating fund in an account opened in the our bank
since 1982 and till date no body has operated on this account again,after 
going through some old files in the records I discovered that the owner of 
the account died long ago in a plane crash along with his
family without leaving a[Heir/WILL] hence the funds is floating and if I do 
not remit this money out urgently it will be forfeited for nothing.The owner 
of this account is Khalifa T.Ibrahim a foreigner
before his death,he was a management consultant and he died since 1992.No 
other person knows about this account or any thing concerning it, the 
account has no other beneficiary and my investigation proved to me as well 
that until his sudden death he was a management consultant.

Since I hardly know any foreigner,I am only contacting you as a foreigner 
partner to stand and apply as his next of kin because this money can not be 
approved to a local person here as his next of kin,without valid 
international foreign passport,but can only be approved to any foreigner 
with valid international passport or drivers license and foreign a/c because 
the money is in US dollars and the former owner of the a/c is a foreigner 
too,and the money can only be approved into a foreign a/c.

I need your full co-operation to make this work fine because the management 
is ready to approve this payment to any foreigner who has correct 
information of this account,which I will give to you upon your positive 
response and once I am convinced that you are capable and will meet up with 
instruction of a key bank official who is deeply involved with me in this 
business.I need your strong assurance that
you will never,never let me down.

With my influence and my position in the bank the bank official can transfer 
this money to any foreigner's reliable account that you can provide with 
assurance that this money will be intact pending on my physical arrival in 
your country for sharing. The bank official Will destroy all documents of 
transaction immediately we receive this money leaving no trace to any place 
and to build confidence you
can call me for heart to heart discussion through my private satellite phone 
which I secured for the security and safety of this business as you know 
that this business is confidential.

At the conclusion of this business,you will be given 35% of the total 
amount,60% will be for me, while 5% will be for expenses both parties might 
have incurred during the process of transferring.

I look forward to your earliest reply through my email address.
you can contact me with:   mnoah12@hotmail.com
Yours truly,

Mr Mona Noah.
