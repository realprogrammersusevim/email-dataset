Attn Sir,
I  am Barr.franklin More a solicitor and legal practitioner based in United 
Kingdom. I am the personal attorney to Dr. George Brumley who was a
consultant with Shell UK LTD here in London, who shall be referred to as my 
client. On the 21st of July 2003, my client Dr. George Brumley and his 
family were involved in a fatal plane crash in Nairobi Kenya, East Africa. 
Unfortunately my client Mr. George and his family lost their lives.
Here is the website of the incident that struck on that faithful  aay 
http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/07/20/kenya.crash/index.html
Since then I have made several enquiries to locate any of my clients  
extended relatives and this has proved unsuccessful. After my several
unsuccessful attempts to locate any member of his family hence I contacted 
you. I am contacting you to assist in repatriating the money left behind by 
my client before they get confiscated or declared unclaimed by the security 
company where this huge deposit were lodged.
Particularly, the finance company where the deceased had the said fund 
valued at USD20 million dollars has issued me a notice to provide the
next of kin. Since I have been unsuccessful in locating the relatives for 
over 3 years, I seek your consent to present you as the next of kin to the 
deceased, so that the proceeds of this account valued at $20 Million Dollars 
can be paid to your account abroad, you will have 30% of the money for your 
role while I will have 60% and 10% for expenses that we may incure in the 
cause of processing the claim.
I have access to all necessary legal documents that can be used to back up 
any claim we may make. All I require is your honest co-operation to
enable us seeing this deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed 
under a legitimate arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the 
law. Please kindly get back to me through my email address or personal 
phone- frankmore@walla.com
number for confidentiality and send to me your telephone and fax numbers to 
enable us discuss further about this transaction.
Best regards
Franklin  More
