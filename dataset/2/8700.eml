Good Day

Please accept my sincere apologizes if my email does not meet your=20
business or personal ethics. I will first introduce myself as Mr. Amos=20
Tower, a staff in the Private Clients Section of a well-known bank,=20
here in London, England.

One of our accounts, with holding balance of =20
=C2=A315,000,000 (Fifteen Million Pounds Sterling) has been dormant and las=
t=20
operated three years ago. From my investigations and confirmation, the=20
owner of the said account, a foreigner by name John Shumejda died on=20
the 4th of January 2002 in a plane crash in Birmingham; you can view=20
this CNN website=20

http://edition.cnn.=20
com/2002/WORLD/europe/01/04/england.plane/  for details on the crash.

Since then, nobody has done anything as regards the claiming of this=20
money, as he has no family member that has any knowledge as to the=20
existence of either the account or the funds; and also Information from=20
the National Immigration also states that he was
single on entry into=20
the UK.

I have confidently discussed this issue with some of the bank=20
officials and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal=20
with. We therefore propose to do business with you, standing in as the=20
next of kin of these funds from the deceased and funds released to you=20
after necessary processes have been followed.

This transaction is=20
totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legitimate and does=20
not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other illegal=20
act.

On your interest, let me hear from you.

Warm Regards,

Mr. Amos=20
Tower.
