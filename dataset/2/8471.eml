Hello,

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal eth=
ics.
I will introduce myself as Mr.Robbin Kuuk, a staff in the accounts manage=
ment
section of the above firm here in the United Kingdom. 

One of our accounts with holding balance of =A315,000,000(Fifteen Million=

British Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past
four (4) years. 

>From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account, a fo=
reigner
by name Kurt Kahle died in July, 2000  and since then nobody has done any=
thing
as regards the claiming of this money because he has no family members wh=
o
are aware of the existence of neither the account nor the funds. 

I have secretly discussed this matter with a senior official of this comp=
any
and we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We th=
us
propose to do business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these
funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes hav=
e
been followed. 

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is legi=
timate
and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other
illegal act. On receipt of your response I will furnish you with detailed=

clarification as it relates to this mutual benefit transaction. I look fo=
rward
to hearing from you as soon as possible if you are interested.
 

Regards, 

Mr.Robbin Kuuk
