address but got no reply=2E
After a month=2C we sent a reminder and finally we discovered from his
contract employers=2C that Mr=2E Michael Creek died from an automobile accident=2E
On further investigation=2C I found out that he did not leave a WILL and all
attempts to trace his next of kin were fruitless=2E I therefore made further
investigation and discovered that Mr=2E Michael Creek did not declare any next
of kin in all his official documents=2C including his Bank Deposit paperwork=2E
This sum of $22=2E4million is still sitting in Standard Chartered Bank and the
interest is being rolled over with the principal sum at the end of each year=2E 
No one will come forward to claim it=2E
According to the laws of the country=2C at the expiration of 5 =28five=29 years=2C
the money will revert to the ownership of the Government if nobody applies
to claim the funds=2E Consequently=2C my proposal is that I will like you to
assist me fully as foreigner to stand in as the next of kin to Mr=2E Michael
creek=2C
so that the fruits of this old man's labour will not get into the
hands of some corrupt officials=2E
This is simple=2C I will like you to provide me immediately with your full
names and address so that the attorney will prepare the necessary documents
and affidavites=2C which will put you in place as the next of kin=2E We shall
employ the services of an  attorneys for drafting and notarization of the
WILL and obtain the necessary documents and letter of probate=2Fadministration
in your favor for the transfer=2E
A bank account in any part of the world=2C which you will provide=2C will then
facilitate the transfer of this money to you as the beneficiary=2Fnext of kin=2E
The money will be paid into your account for us to share in the ratio of 60%
for me and 30% for you while 10% will be set aside for miscellaneous

paperwork for this fund=2C will be done and my position as the Branch Manager
guarantees the successful execution of this transaction=2E
