I write to seek your 
services in a private matter regarding an account i discovered 
belonging to a late customer in my office by the name GENERAL IBRAHIM 
MOUSSA who died in United Kingdom leaving some funds unclaimed in our 
bank without any beneficiary, as the credit officer of my Bank here in 
London,it will be in my interest to transfer this funds worth $20.5
million to your account in your country and this will requires a 
private arrangement.


Could you perhaps be able to receive these funds 
under legal claims then I will fill you in,i am willing to pay a 
generous management and transfer fees as well as appreciation for fewer 
questions asked and your participation yeilds 30%,i need assistance 
from a trustworthy,reliable and confident collaborator whom I will fill 
in as the beneficiary to provide an account where this fund will be 
remmited.


I have all the details/documents and will fill you in if 
you are really willing. Your major role would be to open a bank account 
where the funds will be transferred.


All correspondences will be via 
email, for now, as i said,the funds in question are quite large ($20.5
million).I will expect a straight answer from you. Yes or no. If yes, 
then let's work out the modalities.
