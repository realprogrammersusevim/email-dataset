Attention: The President/CEO 

Dear Sir, 

Confidential Business Proposal 

Having consulted with my colleagues and based on the
information gathered from the South African Chambers Of
Commerce And Industry, I have the privilege to request
your assistance to transfer the sum of $25,500,000.00
(Twenty-five million, five hundred thousand United
States dollars) into your accounts. The above sum
resulted from an over-invoiced contract, executed,
commissioned and paid for about five years (5) ago by
a foreign contractor. This action was however
intentional and since then the fund has been in a
suspense account at The Reserve Bank Of South Africa Apex
Bank. 

We are now ready to transfer the fund overseas and
that is where you come in. It is important to inform
you that as civil servants, we are forbidden to
operate a foreign account; that is why we require your
assistance. The total sum will be shared as follows:
70% for us, 25% for you and 5% for local and
international expenses incidental to the transfer. 

The transfer is risk free on both sides. I am an
accountant with the Department of Minerals and Energy 
Corporation (DME). If you find this proposal
acceptable, we shall require the following documents: 

(a) Your bank name, telephone, your account details and fax
numbers. 

(b) Your private telephone and fax numbers - for
confidentiality and easy communication. 

(c) Your letter-headed paper stamped and signed. 

Alternatively we will furnish you with the text of
what to type into your letter-headed paper, along with
a breakdown explaining, comprehensively what we
require of you. 

Please reply urgently through the below email address.
