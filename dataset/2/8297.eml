HELLO,

MY NAME IS MOHAMMED BIN ABDULLAH  FROM IRAQ. I WORKED WITH THE DEFUNCT REGIME OF SADDAM HUSSAIN AS HIS SECRET ASSISTANCE. WE HANDLE ALL OF HIS FINANCIAL PLANS AND OTHERS.
 
SIR I KNOW THE IMPRESSION THE WORLD HAS ABOUT ANY BODY FROM MY COUNTRY IRAQ,DURING MY TIME WITH THE FORMER REGIME,I WAS ABLE TO SECRETLY REMOVE THE SUM OF $15MILLION US DOLLARS. WHICH I TRIED TO SEND OUTSIDE IRAQ VIA WIRE TRANSFER BUT THE BANK REFUSED BECAUSE OF FEAR OF BEING IMPOUNDED ON BY THE AMERICANS. SOME HOW I MANAGED TO SEND THE MONEY ACROSS IRAQ VIA SECRET COURIER SERVICE.
 
THE FACT THAT THE FUND IS OUTSIDE IRAQ NOW THAT IS MY HAPPINESS, BUT I AM STILL HIDING IN IRAQ TRYING TO SEE HOW I CAN GET OUT, SINCE MY BOSS WAS TOPPLED. I NEED YOUR URGENT AND SINCERE ASSISTANCE TO HELP ME CLEAR THE MONEY FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES TILL I COME OUT OF IRAQ TO MEET WITH YOU.
 
I WILL LET YOU KNOW THE LOCATION AS WELL AS THE DETAILED INFORMATION AS SOON AS YOU ASSURE ME THAT I CAN RELY ON YOU WITHOUT BEEN BETRAYED. PLEASE FOR SAFETY PUROSE, IT IS BETTER WE LIMIT OUT COMMUNICATION TO EMAIL, FOR NOW.YOU ARE GOING TO GET 20% OF THE FUND FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE.

I WILL APPRECIATE IF YOU REPLY ME AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.
 
THANKS,

SINCERELY,

MOHAMMED BIN ABDULLAH
