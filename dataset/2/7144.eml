    wife of the deposed President of Liberia, the African
    settlement of the United states Of American slaves.

    need your aid to relocate to a safe haven my husbands
    personal funds and effects namely 2kg weight of
    Diamond stones and 14 gold bars with $2.4 Million
    USD,all deposited in a safety deposit box in a
    financial institution which will be later disclosed to
    you upon your offer of acceptance.
   =20
    The lives of myself and my children are at risk ever
    since my husband engaged himself in this rebel of a
    thing in my country which later saw him as the
    president of my country.
    We have currently been offered political assylum in
    the Federal Republic Of Nigeria by its
    President,Olusegun Obasanjo,which will confine us to
    its shores for the rest of our lives.
   =20
    I have been assured safety by the United states
    Government and that of the Nigerian Government by a
    meeting held with both Presidents,President George
    Bush Of the United States and that of the Nigerian
    President on the 10th of July 2003 at the just
    concluded Leon Sullivan Summit Held In Nigeria..
   =20
    What you may hear of my husband should you decide to
    verify may not be of a good report but he has learnt
    his lesson the hard way and what i do now i do for the
    sake of my two daughters and son whom i pray to God to
    forgive them from the retribution of the sins of their
    farther.

    aiding me in this matter and will welcome your
    conditions to the best of my abilities.
