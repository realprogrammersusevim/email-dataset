Dear Sir/Madam,

Do accept my sincere apologies if my mail does not meet your personal eth=
ics.
I will introduce myself as a staff in the accounts management section of
a well-known bank here in the United Kingdom. 

One of our accounts with holding balance of =A315,000,000(Fifteen Million=

British Pounds) has been dormant and has not been operated for the past
4 years. 

>From my investigations and confirmations, the owner of this account a for=
eigner
by name Austin Martins died in August 2000 and since then nobody has done=

anything As regards the claiming of this money because he has no family
members who are aware of the existence of neither the account nor the fun=
ds.
Also Information From the National Immigration states that he was also si=
ngle
on entry into the UK.

I have secretly discussed this matter with some of the bank officials and=

we have agreed to find a reliable foreign partner to deal with. We thus
propose to do Business with you, standing in as the next of kin of these
funds from the deceased and funds released to you after due processes hav=
e
been followed. 

This transaction is totally free of risk and troubles as the fund is a le=
gitimate
and does not originate from drug, money laundry, terrorism or any other
illegal act. On your interest, let me hear from you.


Regards,

Gordon.
