ATTN:Sir/Madam,

My name is Mr Michael eze the Manager, Credit and Foreign bills of trust 
bank of africa limited.
I am writing in respect of a foreign customer of my bank with account
number 14-255-2004/utb/t whose name is Joung Heasook, Korea who perished in 
a plane crash[Korean Air Flight 801] with the whole passengers aboard on 
August 6,1997.And for your perusal you can view thisweb site

http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9708/06/guam.passenger.list

Since the demise of this our customer, I personally has watched with
keen interest to see the next of kin but all has proved abortive as no one 
has come to claim his funds of US$25.5M (Twenty Five Million Five Hundred 
Thoudsand United States Dollars) which has been with my branch for a very 
long time.
On this note, I decided to seek for whom his name shall be used as the
Next of Kin as no one has come up to be the next of kin. And the banking 
ethics here does not allow such money to stay more than eight years, because 
money will be recalled to the bank treasury as unclaimed after this period.
In view of this i will give you 30% of the total. Upon the receipt of
your response, I will send you by fax or e-mail the application, bank's fax 
number and the next step to take.I will not fail to bring to your
notice that this business is hitch free and that you should not entertain 
any fear as all modalities for fund transfer can be finalized within five 
banking days, after you apply to the bank as a relation to the deceased.
When you receive this letter. Kindly send me an e-mail signifying your
decision including your private Tel/Fax numbers for quick
communication.

Yours Sincerely,

Mr. Michael eze.
