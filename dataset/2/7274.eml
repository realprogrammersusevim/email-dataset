 I am  BARRISTER JOSEPH BENSON,the Personal Attorney to Mr Larry
Glenn , A foreigner  who used to work with shell development company
in Nigeria.On the 21st of April 1999, my client, his wife And their
three children were involved in a car accident along Sagbama Express
Road.All occupants of the vehicle unfortunately lost there lives.
Since then I have made several enquiries to your embassy to locate
any of my clients extended relatives, this has also proved
unsuccessful.After these several unsuccessful attempts, I decided to
trace his relatives over the Internet, to locate any member of his
family but of no avail, hence I contacted you. I have contacted you
to assist inrepartrating the money before they get confisicated or 
declared unserviceable by the finance house where this
huge deposits were lodged. 
Particularly, the Bank where the deceased had an account valued at 
about 9 million dollars has issued me a notice to provide the next of 
kin or have the account confisicated within the next ten official
working days. since I have been unsuccesfull in locating the
the relatives for over 2 years now I seek your consent to present you
as the next of kin of the deceased the proceeds of this account
valued at $19.8 million dollars can be paid to you and then you and i
can share the money. 55% to me and 40% to you,while 5% should be for
expenses or tax as your government may require,I have all 
necessary legal documents that can be used to back up any claim we
may 
make.All I require is your honest cooperation to enable us see this
deal through. I guarantee that this will be executed under a
legitimate 
arrangement that will protect you from any breach of the law.Please
get 
in touch with me if you indicated interest to enable us discuss
further.
