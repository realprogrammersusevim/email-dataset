FROM:MRS. M SESE-SEKO.

DEAR FRIEND,

 I AM MRS. MARIAM SESE-SEKO WIDOW OF LATE PRESIDENT
MOBUTU SESE-SEKO OF ZAIRE? NOW KNOWN AS DEMOCRATIC
REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC).I RECEIVED YOUR COMPANY
PROFILE FROM THE CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE IN MOROCCO.

 I AM MOVED TO WRITE YOU THIS LETTER, THIS WAS IN
CONFIDENCE CONSIDERING MY PRESENT CIRCUMSTANCE
AND SITUATION.  I ESCAPED ALONG WITH MY HUSBAND
AND TWO OF OUR SONS NZANGA AND MUKOKO OUT OF
DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO (DRC) TO ABIDJAN,
COTE D'IVOIRE WHERE MY FAMILYAND I SETTLED, WHILE
WE LATER MOVED TO SETTLED IN MOROCCO WHERE MY
HUSBAND LATER DIED OF CANCER DISEASE.

 HOWEVER DUE TO THIS SITUATION WE DECIDED TO CHANGED
MOST OF MY HUSBAND'S BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEPOSITED IN
SWISS BANK AND OTHER COUNTRIES INTO OTHER FORMS OF
MONEY CODED FOR SAFE PURPOSE BECAUSE THE NEW HEAD
OF STATE OF (DRC) MR LAURENT KABILA HAS MADE 
ARRANGEMENT WITH THE SWISS GOVERNMENT AND OTHER 
EUROPEAN COUNTRIES TO FREEZE ALL MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
TREASURES DEPOSITED IN SOME EUROPEAN COUNTRIES.
 
 HENCE MY CHILDREN AND I DECIDED LAYING LOW IN AFRICA 
TO STUDY THE SITUATION TILL WHEN THINGS GETS BETTER, 
LIKE NOW THAT PRESIDENT KABILA IS DEAD AND THE SON 
TAKING OVER(JOSEPH KABILA),  ONE OF MY LATE HUSBAND'S 
CHATEAUX IN SOUTHERN FRANCE WAS CONFISCATED BY THE 
FRENCH GOVERNMENT, AND AS SUCH I HAD TO CHANGE MY 
IDENTITY SO THAT MY INVESTMENT WILL NOT BE TRACED AND 
CONFISCATED. I HAVE DEPOSITED THE SUM OF ONE HUNDRED
MILLION UNITED STATE DOLLARS(US$I00,000,000,00.)
WITH A SECURITY COMPANY , FOR SAFEKEEPING.

THE FUNDS ARE SECURITY CODED TO PREVENT THEM FROM 
KNOWING THE CONTENT. WHAT I WANT YOU TO DO IS TO 
INDICATE YOUR INTEREST THAT YOU WILL ASSIST US BY 
RECEIVING THE MONEY ON OUR BEHALF.

ACKNOWLEDGE THIS MESSAGE, SO THAT I CAN INTRODUCE
YOU TO MY SON (NZANGA) WHO HAS THE OUT MODALITIES
FOR THE CLAIM OF THE SAID FUNDS. I WANT YOU TO
ASSIST IN INVESTING THIS MONEY, BUT I WILL NOT
WANT MY IDENTITY REVEALED.

I WILL ALSO WANT TO BUY PROPERTIES AND STOCK
IN MULTI-NATIONAL COMPANIES AND TO ENGAGE IN
OTHER SAFE AND NON-SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS.
MAY  I AT THIS POINT EMPHASISE THE HIGH LEVEL
OF CONFIDENTIALITY, WHICH THIS BUSINESS DEMANDS,
AND HOPE YOU WILL NOT BETRAY THE TRUST AND CONFIDENCE,
WHICH I REPOSE IN YOU.IN CONCLUSION, IF YOU WANT TO
ASSIST US , MY SON SHALL PUT YOU IN THE PICTURE OF
THE BUSINESS, TELL YOU WHERE THE FUNDS ARE
CURRENTLY BEING MAINTAINED AND ALSO DISCUSS OTHER
MODALITIES INCLUDING RENUMERATIONS FOR YOUR SERVICES.

FOR THIS REASON KINDLY FURNISH US YOUR CONTACT
INFORMATION, THAT IS YOUR PERSONAL TELEPHONE
AND FAX NUMBER FOR CONFIDENTIAL PURPOSE AND
ACKNOWLEDGE RECEIPT OF THIS MAIL USING THE
ABOVE EMAIL ADDRESS.

BEST REGARDS,

MRS M. SESE SEKO.
