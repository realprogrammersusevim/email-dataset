Dr. Bernard Makelele
 Pretoria, South Africa.
 
 Sir,
 
 On behalf of my colleagues and I, I write this letter with great pleasure. =
Your information were given to me by a member of the South African Export =
Promotion Council (SAEPC) who was with the Black
 Economic Empowerment Commission (Government) delegation on a trip to the =
United States during a bilateral conference talk to encourage foreign =
investors. I have decided to seek a confidential co-operation with you in =
execution of a business transaction hereunder for the benefit of all parties.=

 
 Within the Department of Mining Resources where I work as the Director of =
Project Implementation, with co-operation of two other top officials, we have =
in our possession, an overdue payment in US funds.
 
 The said funds represent certain percentage of the contract value executed =
on behalf of my Ministry by a foreign contracting firm, which we the =
officials
 over-invoiced to the amount of US$25,500,000.00 (Twenty Five Million Five =
Hundred Thousand United States Dollars). Though the actual contract cost has =
been paid to the original contractor, leaving the excess balance unclaimed.
 
 The Government of the Republic of South Africa believe that private =
investment in general, and foreign direct investment in particular, are the =
real engines for sustainable economic development, for which reason it has =
continued to encourage
 investment in the key growth-oriented sector of Mining with sincere =
determination to pay foreign contractors all debts owed to them, so as to =
continue to enjoy close relationship, and a mutually beneficial co-operation =
with foreign governments and non-governmental financial agencies. As a result =
we included our bills for approvals with the
 co-operation of some officials at the Department of Finance and the Reserve =
Bank of South Africa (RBSA).
 We are seeking your assistance to be the beneficiary of the unclaimed funds, =
since we are not allowed to operate a foreign account. The changing of =
beneficiary\'s information/details and other forms of
 documentation upon application for claim to reflect the contract money and =
its approvals will be secured on behalf of your company or your good self.
 I have the authority of my colleagues involved to propose that, should you =
be willing to assist us in this transaction your share as compensation will =
be 20% while my colleagues and I shall receive 70%, and the balance of 10% =
shall be used to reimburse all expenditures, taxes and miscellaneous expenses =
so incurred.
 It does not matter whether or not your company does contract projects of the =
nature described here. The assumption is that your company won the major =
contract and subcontracted it to other companies.
 More often than not, big trading companies and firms of unrelated fields win =
major contracts, and subcontract to more specialized firms for execution.
 
 This business itself is 100% safe, provided you treat it with utmost =
confidentiality. Also your specialization is not a hindrance to the =
successful
 execution of this mutual beneficiary transaction. I have reposed my =
confidence in you and hope that you will not disappoint us.
 Kindly notify me by email for further details, upon your acceptance of this =
proposal.
 
 Regards,
 
 Dr. Benard Makelele.
