 Dear=2C
 I am Mr=2E Kenneth Iloka=2C Personal Assistant to Alhaji Rewani Lukeman=2C the 
Presidential Adviser on Petroleum Matters=2E My message to you is based 
on some money that floated into the Government treasury due to the 
recent boom in the International Oil Market=2E

The Federal Government of Nigeria budgeted US$18=2E00 per barrel in last 
Year budget=2C but the price was changed in the international oil market 
where a barrel was sold between US$28-US$35=2E00=2E 

We recorded Excess gain=2C and all these could not be accounted for=2C 
hence some executive members in the Petroleum Ministry decided to take away 
the sum of US$18=2C532=2C700=2E00=2C =28Eighteen Million Five Hundred and Thirty 
Two Thousand Seven Hundred United States Dollars=29 to an offshore 
account of a foreign National or company=2E

Please we are not contacting you because we cannot do this business on 
our own successfully=2C but because we are not allowed to operate foreign 
accounts as civil servants=2C that is why we are looking for a foreigner 
we can use and knowing fully well that as a white man=2C the movement of 
the fund will raise no doubt that is why we have decided to contact 
you=2E

If you are interested to assist us=2C please let me have your personal 
telephone=2C fax and email address=2C so that I can furnish you with further 
details on the modalities of the transfer of the fund into your bank 
account=2E Please you are advised to keep this matter to your self=2C as we 
do not want it to be exposed in order not to jeopardize our chances of 
succeeding=2E Let it be known to you that this transaction is hundred 
percent risks free and your security has been well taken care off=2E If you 
are interested in this transaction=2C call me immediately
through my private telephone number 234-1-776 4163 or send me a email 
to ke=5Filoka1965=40themail=2Ecomfor further clarifications=2E
