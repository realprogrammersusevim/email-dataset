Turning $300 Into $20,000

In Oklahoma, Craig
Talkington purchased a Tax Lien on a 5 acre parcel for
$300. The owner failed to pay the taxes and forfeited
the 5-acre parcel to Craig Talkington. A short time
later Craig sold that property to one of the neighbors
for $20,000. That's the kind of money that buys new
cars and sends young people to college. Craig didn't
stop at one deal. He later bought a tax lien for only
$17 on a ten acre track, the property owner failed to
pay the taxes, and Craig ended up the property, which
he sold for $4,000. I don't know how much money you
are making right now but these are the kinds of
profits that change peoples lives and solve financial
problems and make things a lot better.
