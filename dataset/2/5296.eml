(TWENTY ONE MILLION U.S.DOLLARS) ONLY INTO A FOREIGN
ACCOUNT FOR SAFEKEEPING PENDING MY ARRIVAL WITH MY
COLLEAGUES FOR THE SHARING WITH YOU AS THE ACCOUNT OWNER
INTO WHICH THE MONEY IS REMITTED.I AM AN ACCOUNTANT WITH
THE NIGERIAN NATIONAL PETROLEUM CORPORATION(NNPC), LAGOS
AND THIS MONEY ORIGINATED FROM OVER-INVOICED CONTRACT
EXECUTED FOR THE CORPORATION SOME YEARS BACK. THIS CONTRACT
HAS LONG BEEN COMPLETED BY A FOREIGN FIRM AND THE
CONTRACTOR DULY PAID. I NOW SEEK IF YOU WOULD PERMIT THE
SURPLUS TO BE REMITTED INTO YOUR ACCOUNT. AS A MATTER OF
FACT, WE ARE TOP GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND WE CANNOT COME
OUT OPENLY TO CLAIM THIS AMOUNT. THIS IS WHY WE ARE LOOKING
FOR A COMPETENT AND HONEST COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL ABROAD
WHOSE DOCUMENTS WOULD BE TENDERED BY US HERE IN NIGERIA AS
ONE OF THE CONTRACTORS THAT EXECUTED THE PROJECT.HOWEVER, I
WOULD WISH TO RECEIVE YOUR PERSONAL ASSURANCE THAT YOU
WOULDNOT SIT ON THE MONEY WHEN IT GOES INTO YOUR
ACCOUNT.MORE IMPORTANTLY, YOU KEEP CONFIDENTIAL THIS
TRANSACTION, IN ORDER NOT TO TARNISH THE CONFIDENCE REPOSE
IN THE OFFICIALS INVOLVED IN THIS TRANSACTION.TO EFFECT
THIS TRANSFER, I THEREFORE REQUEST THE FOLLOWING:YOUR
ACCOUNT NUMBER, THE NAME OF YOUR BANK, ADDRESS, TELEX,
TELEPHONE AND FAX NUMBERS WHERE THE MONEY WOULD BE
TRANSFERRED INTO AND ALSO YOUR PRIVATE FAX AND TELEPHONE
NUMBERS FOR QUICK COMMUNICATION.SO FAR, AFTER DUE
CONSULTATIONS, YOU WERE STRONGLY AND RELIABLY RECOMMENDED
TO US ALTHOUGH WE HAVE NOT MET OR ENTERED INTO ANY KIND OF
CONTRACT WITH YOU BEFORE AS TO KNOW THE EXTENT OF
YOUR<BR>HONESTY, BUT BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATIONS, I
PERSONALLY WANT TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE HONEST ENOUGH AND
WOULD NOT SIT ON THE MONEY IF FINALLY GOT INTO YOUR
ACCOUNT. IT IS ON THIS NOTE THAT I CONSIDER IT PROPER TO
WRITE YOU ASKING FOR YOUR PERMISSION AND SUPPORT TO
TRANSFER THIS AMOUNT INTO YOUR ACCOUNT.YOU SHOULD NOT FEAR
ANY RISK BECAUSE WE HAVE CONCLUDED ARRANGEMENT TO SAVE
GUIDE YOU IN THE TRANSACTION. THIS BUSINESS IS 100% RISK
FREE. HENCE IT REQUIRES HIGH LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE AND
SECRECY.MEANWHILE THIS IS THE BREAKDOWN OF THE SHARING
MODALITIES:A. 10% WILL BE USED TO SETTLE TRANSFER CHARGES
AND LEGAL PROTOCOLS;B. 30% IS FOR USING YOUR ACCOUNT;. 60%
OF IT WILL BE FOR US THE ORIGINATORS.BE INFORMED THAT ON
COMPLETION OF THIS BUSINESS I WILL USE PART OF MY MONEY TO
INVEST IN YOUR COUNTRY UNDER YOUR CARE.PLEASE NOTE THAT THE
TRANSFER OPERATION WILL TAKE SEVEN TO TEN WORKING DAYS TO
BE COMPLITED.PLEASE CONTACT ME BY THE ABOVE ALTERNATIVE
EMAIL ADDRESS.

MY DEEPEST PRAYERS FOR YOU.
